"""Says when the host toolchain is old enough that clippy here is weaker than the one CI runs.

CI installs whatever stable is on the day it runs, and clippy gains lints with every release, so a
host a few releases behind passes a lint that CI fails. Nothing in a diff shows this, and the
report arrives as a CI failure on code that was checked before it was pushed.

Rust ships every six weeks and rustc states its own release date, so the gap is measurable without
asking the network what stable is today.
