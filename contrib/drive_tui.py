"""Drive the bravebot TUI from a script, for testing the paths a unit test cannot reach.

The interface is most of this program and none of it is reachable from `cargo test`. A slash
command, the context gauge, a trust prompt, resuming a session: each one is a keystroke going
into a real terminal and pixels coming back, and the tests underneath them can only check the
pieces. Every bug found in the TUI so far has been in the wiring between those pieces.

A pty is what makes this possible. The interface reads keys from a terminal rather than from
standard input, so piping to it does nothing: the process has to be given a terminal of its own,
which is what `pty.fork` does here.

Keys are typed rather than written. A whole line written in one call is how another program types
at a terminal, and the interface reads that as a paste rather than as typing, so the line would
land in the box and the Enter at the end of it would not send. See `PACE` below.

Waiting is by silence rather than by clock. While a turn runs the spinner animates several times
a second, so the stream is never quiet; the moment it stops, the turn is over. So each step names
the longest it will wait and returns as soon as the screen has been still for a moment, which is
both quicker and far less brittle than sleeping for a guess.

What this is not is a terminal emulator. Escape sequences are stripped rather than interpreted,
so what comes out has the right characters in the right order and the wrong shape: a sentence the
interface wrapped across two lines arrives with a box border in the middle of it. Assert against
`--squash`, which removes whitespace and box-drawing entirely, rather than against the raw text.

Usage:

    contrib/drive_tui.py session.txt -- target/debug/bravebot
    contrib/drive_tui.py - --squash -- target/debug/bravebot --resume  < session.txt

A script is one step per line, `timeout` then the keys to send:

    # Answer the trust prompt, ask something, then summarise the conversation.
    5    y
    60   what is 2 plus 2\r
    60   /compact\r
    5    /exit\r

Blank lines and `#` comments are ignored. Backslash escapes are the usual ones, plus `\\e` for
escape and `\\x03` for ctrl-c.
