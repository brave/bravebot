# Nothing in this repository configures that scan: it arrives as an
# organization-level workflow that calls brave/security-action, so the only
# copy of the runner definitions is in that repository. This clones it, pins
# the same tool versions its action.yml pins, and drives the same
# reviewdog.yml runners against this checkout. The findings are the ones the

#                                 no upstream remote to compare against
#   check-reviewdog.sh --full     the whole tree, however old the finding is
#
# The two modes are the action's own two modes. On a pull request it runs
# baseline_scan_only, which passes opengrep --baseline-commit and filters
# every runner through the diff; on workflow_dispatch it scans everything
# with -filter-mode=nofilter. Dirty files need a scan without the commit-only
# baseline; reviewdog still filters them through the diff.
#
# No model is involved, so this is deterministic and cheap to re-run.
