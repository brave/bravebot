# Best practices

What a reviewer holds a pull request against. Every rule here is one a person has to read a diff to
decide.

Nothing here restates a rule a tool already enforces or could: formatting, lints, clause numbering,
the lockfiles, an em-dash, an attribution marker, a `declassify` outside the gates. Those belong in
`make check`, `make check-spec`, `make check-npm`, `make check-deps` and the security scan, and a
rule that can be written as one of those checks is a bug against this directory rather than an
entry in it.

| Read | For |
|---|---|
| [best-practices/specs.md](best-practices/specs.md) | prose a clause is allowed to be |
| [best-practices/tests.md](best-practices/tests.md) | what a test is named, what it covers, and proving it fails first |
| [best-practices/writing.md](best-practices/writing.md) | comments, and what is never written anywhere |
| [best-practices/dependencies.md](best-practices/dependencies.md) | what a new crate has to be worth, and why a regex is not free |

The review pass over the rule this repository exists for is
[development/reviewing-for-the-rule.md](development/reviewing-for-the-rule.md): the four
shapes a violation takes in a diff, and the argument that mistakes a sound design for one.
[specs/](specs/README.md) is the source of truth for behaviour, and a spec wins where a spec
and a rule here disagree.
