# The security scan

Pull requests here are scanned by an organization-level workflow that runs
[brave/security-action](https://github.com/brave/security-action) and comments through reviewdog.
Nothing in this repository configures it, so the runners and the rule set live over there.

```sh
make check-reviewdog       # what this branch changed, against its merge base
make check-reviewdog-full  # the whole tree, however old the finding is
```

`contrib/check-reviewdog.sh` clones that repository, pins the tool versions its `action.yml` pins,
and drives the same reviewdog runners against this checkout: **opengrep** (the semgrep fork, on
Brave's rule set), **npm-audit**, **pip-audit**, **safesvg**, and **sveltegrep**. Only the runners
with something to look at are enabled, which here means opengrep and npm-audit. A finding is one
the bot would post, so run `check-reviewdog` before pushing; the full scan reports plenty that
predates any given branch.

The branch is measured against `upstream/main` where a checkout has one, and `origin/main`
otherwise. In a fork checkout `origin` is the fork, whose `main` moves only when somebody
updates it, so a base taken from there is a commit the branch is not based on: the scan then
covers every commit the fork is behind and reports whatever it finds in them against the
branch. `--base` takes any ref, a sha or a tag included.

The first run downloads opengrep, reviewdog and the rules into `~/.cache`; later runs re-use them
and take about half a minute. No model is involved, so both are deterministic.

A runner failure makes the check fail, including a scanner failure hidden by a later
formatter in its pipeline. Runner stderr also fails the check so a partial scan cannot
report a clean result. `make check-reviewdog` first runs isolated regression tests for
empty scans, findings and scanner failures in both scan modes.
