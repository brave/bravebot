## Scope

Before the planner is asked anything, its context is pre-filled with instructions nobody typed
this turn: `AGENTS.md`, which says how work is done somewhere, the name and description of every
skill on offer, and when memory is on the live rows in `core.jsonl`. This spec is about
**resolution**: which files are looked for, where, in what order, and where what they say ends up.

It does not cover what a skill file looks like or what any source is trusted for, which is
[skills.md](skills.md), nor what a label means once assigned, which is [labels.md](labels.md), nor
the episodic store or how similarity recall is placed, which is [memory.md](memory.md).

## The sources

<a id="INSTR-1"></a>
### INSTR-1: five sources, and no others

| File | Applies to |
|---|---|
| `~/.bravebot/AGENTS.md` | every project |
| `~/.bravebot/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` | every project |
| `<workspace>/AGENTS.md`, else `CLAUDE.md`, else `.claude/CLAUDE.md` | this project |
| `<workspace>/.bravebot/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` | this project |
| `~/.bravebot/agent_memory/core.jsonl` | every project when memory is on |

The two roots are spelled differently on purpose: the user's own directory is already `.bravebot`,
so its skills sit directly beneath it, while a project keeps its own out of the way in a dotted
directory rather than at the root where `AGENTS.md` sits.

The project's instructions are looked for under more than one name, in the order above, and the
first that exists is the source. Not all of them: a repository holding two of these holds one set
of instructions under two names, and reading both would state everything twice.

**Why more than one name.** More than one is in use, and a project that wrote its conventions down
should not have them ignored over the spelling. This is still one source, resolved by name.

There is no search of parent directories and no nested instructions file. A file at any other path
is an ordinary file, read only when something asks for it by name, or when the source names it,
which is [INSTR-8](#INSTR-8). Episodic recall is not a source here; it is
[memory.md](memory.md#MEM-8). Row shape, caps, and writes for `core.jsonl` are there too.

**Why no walking upwards.** A rule that walked upwards would pick up instructions from whatever
happened to be above a project on this machine, which is a different set of instructions on the
next machine.

### INSTR-2: `~/.bravebot` is the directory the environment names, and there is no fallback

It is `.bravebot` inside the home directory the environment gives. When there is no home, or the
name is empty, there is no user directory and everything kept there is simply absent. Nothing is
guessed and no other location is tried.

**Why.** A fallback would read instructions from a directory the user never chose, and this is
the one place whose contents are trusted for being the user's own. Daemons and containers run
without a home, and everything kept there is optional, so absence is a case to do without rather
than a reason to refuse to start.

<a id="INSTR-3"></a>
### INSTR-3: only the project root is a source, never a directory opened alongside it

A directory opened by name during a session widens where files may be read from. It adds no
standing instructions and no skills, whatever it contains.

**Why.** Opening a directory to read one file out of it would otherwise change how every later
turn behaves, which is not what the person opening it asked for. The project root is what
relative paths mean and what the session is keyed on, and having one answer to "which project is
this" is what keeps that unambiguous.

## What wins

<a id="INSTR-4"></a>
### INSTR-4: sources are read least specific first, so the project has the last word

The user's own directory is read before the project. Both `AGENTS.md` files are read and both
reach the planner, in that order, and a project skill replaces a global one of the same name.
This is the same "most specific wins" rule the trust map uses for paths.

**Why.** A habit carried between projects should hold until the project says otherwise. Shadowing
by name rather than merging is what lets a project override one skill without restating the rest.

<a id="INSTR-5"></a>
### INSTR-5: what is resolved goes into the system prompt, never into the conversation

Standing instructions, the catalogue of skill names, and live core memory are put
in front of each request as part of the system prompt. They are not appended to the stored
conversation, so a session running many turns carries one copy of them however long it runs.

**Why.** The system prompt belongs to the build rather than to the conversation. Sending the same
instructions as a message each turn would accumulate a copy per turn, crowding out the task and
paying for the same text repeatedly, and it would leave the planner reading its own conventions
as though a person had just said them.

<a id="INSTR-6"></a>
### INSTR-6: a source that is not there is not an error

No `AGENTS.md`, no skills directory, no user directory at all: each is the ordinary case, costs
no notice and no refusal, and offers nothing.

**Why.** Nothing is assumed from silence, so an absent source and an empty one say the same thing.
A warning for the common case is a warning people learn to scroll past, and the times a source
really was dropped are the times that has to be read.

<a id="INSTR-7"></a>
### INSTR-7: the sources are resolved afresh every turn

Discovery runs per turn rather than once at startup. Writing an `AGENTS.md` or a skill mid-session
takes effect on the next turn, including when the agent wrote it itself. There is nothing to
reload and no session to restart.

**Why.** Reading once at startup would make the file just written the one instruction the planner
cannot see, and the fix for that would be to restart, which loses the conversation.

<a id="INSTR-8"></a>
### INSTR-8: an instructions file that only names another one is followed, once

Where the project's instructions are under [`POINTER_BYTES`] and name a markdown file in the
workspace, that file is read instead and is what reaches the planner. Once only: what it names in
turn is not followed.

Length is the whole test. A document is not a pointer however many files it cites, so anything
longer is read as itself and its citations are left alone.

The pointer is resolved by the same `workspace.read` that governs every other path, so confinement
and the trust map decide whether the named file may be opened. A pointer naming something outside
the workspace is refused there, and an untrusted directory's instructions never reach this rule at
all: they are a notice and no text.

**Why.** Repositories that support several agents keep one real document and point the other names
at it. Handed the pointer, a planner spends a call reading what it was about to be given anyway:
a whole round trip, which is the expensive part of a turn, to learn nothing. This was measured: a
project whose `AGENTS.md` read "Refer to canonical agent instructions in `.claude/CLAUDE.md`." cost
exactly that.

<a id="INSTR-9"></a>
### INSTR-9: where the planner is working is stated, and is not read through the trust gate

The system prompt says the working directory, whether the tree is a git repository, the platform,
the OS version, the shell, today's date, and the directory this session has to itself
([trust-map.md](trust-map.md)) where it has one, with what that directory is for and the name a
program started from a command line reads its path from. A session that has none has nothing said
about one. These are facts about the machine, and the prompt says so: they are not instructions and
nothing is asked of the planner on their account.

They do not pass `read_trusted_content`, and that is the difference between them and every other
source here. There is no file behind any of them. The root is where the user pointed the session,
and the rest comes from the kernel and this process's own environment, which is the provenance
[ROUTE-*](routing.md) relies on for a command the user typed. So there is nothing to vouch for and
no label to refuse. Nothing read out of the workspace may be added to this block, because the whole
argument for skipping the gate is that no source in the tree contributes to it.

Composed per turn like everything else here, so `/cd` ([TRUST-13](trust-map.md#TRUST-13)) is
followed: the next turn states where the session went.

**Why.** Each of these otherwise costs a `run` to discover, and a run costs two prompts, not one:
the plan is approved, and then the output comes back quarantined so the planner has to ask to be
shown it. A planner that does not know its own working directory reaches for `pwd`, which is that
whole exchange for a value the driver has had since startup. The date is stated for a different
reason: a model's sense of it comes from its training and is wrong by however long ago that was.

The session's own directory is stated for a third reason: no `run` could discover it. Nothing names
it but this process, so a planner never told of it has nowhere it knows of to put a file that is not
part of the project and writes one into the project instead, which is the file a build, a commit and
a reviewer each have to deal with. Saying nothing where there is no such directory is the same
argument the other way: a path to a directory that is not there costs a turn the run that finds out.

## Known costs

Accepted deliberately. Do not "fix" one without changing this spec first.

- **Resolution costs a directory listing and up to three file reads every turn.** Cheap next to the
  model call it precedes, and the alternative is a cache that has to be invalidated by something,
  which is a second thing to be wrong about how the filesystem looks.
- **A pointer that points at a pointer is not followed twice.** A chain is a mistake in the project
  rather than a layout to support, and the second read is where a cycle would become a hang.
- **The date is UTC, not local.** The offset is not knowable without a timezone database, and a
  dependency for one line of the prompt is the worse trade. A planner near midnight may be a day
  out, which matters to nothing that is not already asking the user.
- **A project cannot turn off a global `AGENTS.md`.** The project's file has the last word, but
  the global one is still in front of the planner and can still be followed where the project
  says nothing that contradicts it. Deleting the global file, or narrowing it, is the only way to
  remove it, since a project is not the right place to be granted power over the user's own
  configuration.
