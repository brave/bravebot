## Scope

Every request this process makes to the network: what has to be true before one leaves, and what
comes back. What the returned bytes are labelled, and what may then be done with them, is
[labels.md](labels.md).

## Clauses

<a id="NET-1"></a>
### NET-1: this process has one way out, and it is not optional

Every outbound request this process makes goes through a single call. The HTTP client is private to
that module and no other crate depends on it, so there is no second path that could skip the gate.

**Why.** This is the whole property, and it is structural rather than a matter of discipline. In
the design this replaces, using the hardened helper was optional and two of three fetchers
bypassed the redirect check.

`verified-by: bravebot_net::egress::a_fetch_without_the_capability_is_refused`

<a id="NET-2"></a>
### NET-2: a redirect is revalidated on every hop

Redirects are followed by hand and each new URL is put to the gate before it is fetched. The chain
is bounded, so a loop ends rather than running forever.

**Why.** Following redirects automatically would mean the gate only ever saw the first URL, and a
permitted host could hand off to a denied one.

Revalidating is what makes a hop checkable; what the check consists of depends on why the request is
being made. For a `fetch_url` call it is [FETCH-4](tools/fetch-url.md#FETCH-4), which holds the
chain to the host a person approved. For this program's own connection to its endpoint it is the
capability and nothing more, for the reason that clause gives.

<a id="NET-3"></a>
### NET-3: only http and https ever reach the network

Any other scheme is refused before a connection is attempted, rather than handed to a library to
interpret.

**Why.** A URL is routing, and a scheme this code does not understand is a destination nobody
decided on.

<a id="NET-4"></a>
### NET-4: a body is capped, and a truncated one says so

Past the cap the body is cut, and the result reports that it was. A body that stops partway is a
failure rather than a short success, and a read that fails is not reported as a short body.

**Why.** Silence would let a caller treat half an answer as the whole one. This is resource
hygiene, not content inspection: the bytes are never parsed to decide anything.

<a id="NET-5"></a>
### NET-5: each phase of a request is bounded separately

Connecting, starting to reply, and continuing to reply are timed apart. A reply that is still
arriving is not cut off for having taken a while to start, and one that stops arriving is given
up on rather than waited for indefinitely.

**Why.** One timeout over the whole call cannot tell a slow answer from a dead connection, and
choosing a single number makes one of those two cases wrong.

<a id="NET-6"></a>
### NET-6: a failure that means "not now" may be retried, and nothing else may

A connection that gave out is worth another attempt. A refusal is not, and only the statuses that
mean the server is temporarily unable are treated as retryable.

**Why.** Retrying a refusal turns one denied request into several.

## Known costs

- **`bravebot-net` is not the only crate that opens a socket.** `bravebot-skus` builds its own
  HTTP client for the subscription service. That traffic carries credentials and an order id,
  never workspace content or model output, so no labelled value escapes the gate. NET-1 is about
  everything carrying labelled content. A second egress in this process that ever carried content
  would be a violation.

- **A program this agent starts makes its own requests, and they do not come through here.** `run`
  ([tools/run.md](tools/run.md)) executes programs, and a line the user typed in shell mode
  ([shell-mode.md](shell-mode.md)) goes to a real shell with nothing asked first, so an approved
  `curl`, `git push` or package install reaches the network without passing this gate. Unlike
  `bravebot-skus`, this path can carry the user's own data: a program runs with the access their
  shell would give it, so it can read a private file and send it. Nothing routes or inspects those
  requests, and the host rules a `fetch_url` call is held to do not reach them. What stands in front
  of the path is the prompt that asks before a program runs and a `Bash` deny rule
  ([permissions.md](permissions.md)), both of which refuse a command rather than govern its traffic.
  Operating-system confinement would govern it, and is applied to the stdio servers it exists for
  rather than to a program somebody asked for ([sandboxing.md](sandboxing.md)); whether to confine
  those is issue #4.

- **Two pairs of phases share a bound rather than having one each.** The transport gives a phase
  the earliest of its own deadline and those of the phases before it, so a bound tight enough to
  time one phase precisely cuts the phase after it short as well. Each number it is given
  therefore covers every phase it governs: resolving a name is allowed as long as connecting, and
  writing a request body as long as the send and reply bounds together. Both are resolved in
  favour of the later phase, because that is what the clause is for. A slow answer must not be
  read as a dead connection, and timing the phase before it precisely at the price of cutting the
  answer short would be exactly the failure this clause forbids.
