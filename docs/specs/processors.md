## Scope

The one component in the system that reads untrusted content. What it is given, what it may do,
and how what it produces is labelled and written.

## Why it exists

An agent that may not read a file also cannot change it: `edit_file` refuses on an untrusted file
and a whole-file `write_file` would need a body the planner could only have guessed.
Without processors the agent could answer questions about a repository nobody vouched for and do
no work in one.

## Clauses

<a id="PROC-1"></a>
### PROC-1: a processor holds no capabilities at all

| | |
|---|---|
| Tools | none, and the request carries no tool list at all |
| Memory | none: the messages are built from nothing each time |
| Conversation | one request, one reply, no loop to steer |
| Reads | exactly the references named in `reads`, and nothing else |
| Writes | at most one new reference, and nothing else |

A call mints **one slot or none**: the document, when the answer said where the document begins,
and nothing at all when it did not. The remark is a second output but never a slot: it is reported
to the person watching and cannot be read, written or passed to another processor.

**Why.** A processor with one tool is a second planner with untrusted content in its context,
which is the thing this design refuses. A loop would give a reply something to steer.

<a id="PROC-2"></a>
### PROC-2: the spec is built by the driver and frozen before the run

The driver builds the spec, in one place, and nothing widens one afterwards.

`verified-by: by-construction (building a spec takes a SpecAuthority, minted only inside policy.rs, which is one of the files this spec governs, so no other module can build one at all; every field is private and no method takes &mut self, so nothing widens one once it is built)`

<a id="PROC-3"></a>
### PROC-3: the output label is computed before the processor runs

By taint over the inputs. Nothing the processor writes has any say in how what it writes is
labelled.

`verified-by: bravebot_core::policy::an_output_is_labelled_by_taint_over_the_inputs`

<a id="PROC-4"></a>
### PROC-4: the input is assembled by the policy layer

The policy layer, the part of `bravebot-core` that owns the gates, concatenates the slots. The driver carries the result wrapped and hands it to the call
without seeing it. The `instruction` comes from the planner and must not
be private.

`verified-by: bravebot_core::policy::a_private_instruction_cannot_direct_a_processor`

<a id="PROC-5"></a>
### PROC-5: the output is never shown to the planner

It is presented like any other untrusted content: a reference, and nothing else.

`verified-by: bravebot_agent::turn::what_a_processor_says_reaches_the_person_and_no_model`

<a id="PROC-6"></a>
### PROC-6: an answer is for one document, and belongs only where the planner said

A write of a processor's answer is refused anywhere but the file the planner said the call was
about. Where the planner said nothing, the answer belongs nowhere and may be written nowhere,
unless the whole of what the processor was given is one document, which is then the document its
answer is for. One file beside any other input is not that: an answer over a document and an
earlier answer is for neither of them.

A plan fixed before the run is no exception. It names its destinations in advance, which says
nothing about which document an answer is for.

**Why.** This is not a label rule and cannot be one. Every gate passed when a planner wrote a
game's HTML into a Python script, because the destination was a path it named and a person
approved it.

<a id="PROC-7"></a>
### PROC-7: nothing a processor writes is a file unless it says where the file begins

Everything before the document marker is a remark for the person watching: it reaches a
screen and stops, no model reads it, it is not part of any file, and it cannot be another
processor's input. Everything after the line is the document. An answer with no line names no
document and can be written nowhere.

**Why.** That way round on purpose. It was the other way, prose being the default and the line the
exception, and a processor explaining why it was leaving a Python script alone wrote the
explanation over the script. A processor has one output and has always wanted two, so forgetting
which is which has to fail towards changing nothing. Which document the answer is for is likewise
marked on the document, not left to the instruction to describe: one given two files and told in
prose the answer was for the second returned the first, and the first went into the second's file.

<a id="PROC-8"></a>
### PROC-8: quarantined content becomes a file body, and never anything else

A private slot may become a file body. That is sound only
because the destination is inside the boundary the bytes came from, so nothing leaves. The trust map
then records that path as untrusted, so reading it back does not launder it.

**Never** reach for it for a network body, a command line, or a message to someone.

## Boundaries

<a id="PROC-9"></a>
### PROC-9: the confinement is the capability set, not an operating system boundary

There is no untrusted code involved: the call is made by the same trusted driver that makes every
other call. `bravebot-sandbox` confines processes running code we did not write, and putting a
processor in a subprocess would confine the wrong thing.

`verified-by: none`

<a id="PROC-10"></a>
### PROC-10: a check over one slot is not put in a subprocess either, and for the same reason

Asking a second model whether one quarantined slot looks like an injection attempt is a call of
the same shape as a processor's, so PROC-9 settles it: the code making the call is ours, and a
subprocess would hold the wrong thing. What such a check holds is narrower still, since it can
write nothing at all; [vetting.md](vetting.md) is where that is set out.

Recorded here so that the next person to ask finds the answer rather than reopening PROC-9. The
technique this is ported from does use a subprocess, and what it is containing there is an agent
with tools, a filesystem and a network, which can *act* when it is injected rather than merely
answer wrongly. Nothing here has any of those to begin with.

`verified-by: none`

## What the person sees

<a id="PROC-11"></a>
### PROC-11: a remark is drawn as untrusted content and nothing else

The remark reaches the person watching through the quarantined path and no other: reported as
content in no model's context, and drawn inside the margin the renderer owns, with every control
character replaced. So it cannot paint a margin of its own, cannot make its words look like
something bravebot said, and says on the screen whose words they are.

**Why.** The remark is free text a processor authors over an untrusted file, so it is
attacker-influenced like anything else a processor produces, and the whole of what it can do is
say something untrue. That ceiling is held by how the remark is drawn rather than by where it
goes, and nothing pinned it to that path: the reach it is reported with is set in one place,
[PROC-5](#PROC-5)'s test asserts the remark is shown and that no model saw it but nothing about
how it is drawn, and no test in the interface drew a remark at all.

`verified-by: bravebot_tui::marking::a_remark_is_drawn_inside_the_margin_it_cannot_forge`

<a id="PROC-12"></a>
### PROC-12: a remark is put beside the write it describes

The remark is carried with the document it accompanies and drawn in the question about writing
that document, above the diff, as untrusted content. A write the planner wrote itself has no
remark and shows none.

It decides nothing. No gate reads it, an approval is given from the diff of the real bytes, and a
write goes the same way with the remark as without it. What it is for is that the claim and the
evidence are read in one place.

**Why.** Nothing checks a remark against the document it accompanies and nothing could, so a
processor can say it fixed one line while the document does something else. What kept that from
mattering was that the remark is not the decision, and what was left was the ordering: the remark
enters the transcript when the processor returns, and the question comes rounds later, so a person
read the diff with the claim about it some way up the screen. A claim can only be caught out
against the thing it is a claim about. "I only fixed the typo" beside three hundred changed lines
is visibly untrue; remembered from earlier it is not.

Capped, for the same reason it is drawn at all: a remark long enough to push the diff out of the
box would be the reader losing the evidence instead of gaining the claim. In lines and in width
where it is released, and again in drawn rows where it is drawn, because a line wider than the box
is several rows and only the box knows how wide it is
([PROMPT-4](prompting.md#PROMPT-4)). What either cap left out is said, and the transcript above
holds the fuller preview.

## Known costs

- **An untrusted file's contents reach the backend.** A processor is a model call, so working on
  a file nobody vouched for sends it where before it would have stayed on the machine. The
  destination is the one a trusted directory has always sent its files to. What is new is only
  that the reader holds nothing.
- **One approval per candidate, not per change.** Where several files could be the one, each is
  read into its own slot, transformed with the same instruction, and written back to the path it
  came from. A candidate the answer marked no document for is not written at all, so the
  approvals count the files that changed rather than the files considered.
