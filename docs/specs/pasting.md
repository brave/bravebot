## Scope

What Ctrl-V puts into a turn, whether it is text or a picture, and on what footing. Pasted text is
presentation and holds no labels: it is the user's own words either way, and the only question is
that the box stays readable. A pasted picture is a claim about provenance, and most of this spec is
about that claim. A paste leaves a marker in the box, and deleting the marker takes the paste off.

Three gestures put content into a turn on the user's own footing, and each has its own spec:
[naming-files.md](naming-files.md) for `@` in a prompt, [pasting.md](pasting.md) for Ctrl-V, and
[dropping.md](dropping.md) for a file dragged onto the window.

## Why a pasted picture is trusted

A pasted picture is trusted because the user pasted it, exactly as they typed the words beside it.
It arrives in their own message, on the footing of the prompt it came with, and the gate that
admits it records that provenance and asserts nothing else. Nothing inspects the pixels and nothing
could. Being a picture establishes nothing: the trust comes from the gesture and from nowhere else.

It is carried whole rather than quarantined because a processor takes text slots and returns text,
so there is no reference an image could be reduced to. That is a fact about the mechanism, and not
a second reason to trust it.

## Clauses

### PASTE-1: a long paste folds to a marker, and the words are what get sent

More than a couple of lines folds to `[Pasted text #2 +40 lines]`, counting the lines a person
would count. The words around it are left alone, and a short paste lands whole. A paste into a
command line is never folded. A paste ending in a newline does not send.

The words are put back where the line leaves the box, so the request, the transcript and the
history all hold the paste itself. The marker goes no further than the box: a prompt coming back
for editing after a stop comes back behind it.

**Why.** A stack trace would otherwise push the reply being read off the screen. Nothing is hidden:
what is about to be sent is what the prompt says, and deleting the marker drops the words.

**Why the marker stops at the box.** It is a handle on text that only the session holding it can
put back. In the transcript it makes the conversation claim something the planner was never given.
In the history it comes back in a later session naming nothing, and the placeholder is sent in
place of everything the person pasted, with nothing on the screen to say so.

### PASTE-2: only a picture a human pasted

Never bytes a tool read, never anything a processor produced, never an image a path in model
output named. Each of those is content, and routing it here would launder it.

**Why.** The justification cannot be checked from the bytes, so it lives at the call site. Today
that is the TUI's Ctrl-V and nothing else.

<a id="PASTE-3"></a>
### PASTE-3: the media type is the driver's, never the content's

It ends up in the data URL, where it is routing, so it comes from a fixed set
the clipboard reader owns, and never from a filename or from what a tool printed.

`verified-by: by-construction (the type is a static string from the clipboard reader's literals to the data URL it is formatted into, so a media type read from a filename or from what a tool printed does not compile)`


<a id="PASTE-4"></a>
### PASTE-4: the picture is inlined, never linked

A URL would have the endpoint fetch it over a connection this process never makes, which is an
egress `bravebot-net` could not gate.

<a id="PASTE-5"></a>
### PASTE-5: a paste does not lower context integrity

It says nothing about content the planner has met. Lowering it here would have a screenshot mark
everything the planner then wrote as untrusted, on the strength of the user's own input.

<a id="PASTE-6"></a>
### PASTE-6: what is sent is what the prompt says

The marker is written where the caret is and the picture goes wherever that text goes. Deleting
the marker unsends it. A prompt recalled from the history carries no pictures and names none: the
marker is not what gets remembered, because it stands for a screenshot only the session that
pasted it holds, and the words around it are what the person meant. A picture is refused in shell
mode rather than written into the command. Anything over 10 MB is refused rather than sent, and
says so with its size.

<a id="PASTE-7"></a>
### PASTE-7: reading the clipboard is presentation plumbing and holds no labels

Command-V is the terminal's chord and never reaches this process: the byte stream over a pty has
no encoding for that modifier, and the terminal writes the clipboard's *text* into the pty instead,
which is why a picture silently arrives as nothing. Ctrl-V comes through as a byte, so the TUI goes
around the terminal and reads the clipboard itself. An empty paste is read as the picture that was
meant. A picture wins over text when the clipboard holds both, since copying an image in a browser
leaves the page's URL behind as text and text has another key.

On macOS this reads the pasteboard through `osascript`. On Linux it needs `wl-paste` or `xclip`.

### PASTE-8: every paste is named in the audit trail

With its type and size, so `--trace` and Ctrl-T account for the pictures as well as the words.

<a id="PASTE-9"></a>
### PASTE-9: a pasted picture is kept with the session and comes back on resume

The picture is part of the user's own message, so it is written into the session record alongside
the words and a resumed turn still has it. The redrawn transcript shows what the interface recorded
about the attachment rather than the bytes, because a data URI in the scrollback is not a
transcript.

**Why.** Resuming a session that turned on a screenshot, without the screenshot, would leave the
planner answering about something it can no longer see. Quarantined content is not written down at
all, and this is not an exception to that: a pasted picture was never quarantined, it is the user's
own input.

`verified-by: bravebot_tui::state::a_resumed_prompt_that_carried_a_picture_shows_its_words_and_not_the_bytes`

## Known costs

- **A pasted picture lands on disk.** It is written into the session record so a resume can restore
  it (PASTE-9), which means a screenshot pasted into a session outlives the session. Deleting the
  session removes it.

- **A screenshot of a hostile page puts a stranger's words into the planner's context as though
  the user had typed them.** Nothing inspects the pixels and nothing could. What justifies it is
  that the user chose what to copy, can see on their own screen what they pasted, and is the party
  this serves. It is the cost shell mode carries, reached by another route.
