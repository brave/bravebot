## Scope

What is kept between runs: the record of a session so it can be picked up again, the questions a
person asked beside it, the prompts they typed so they can be recalled, and what a session says on
its way out about being picked up. What a resume does to standing permissions is
[prompting.md](prompting.md); what the trail contains
is [trace.md](trace.md). Everything else the command line does is [cli.md](cli.md), which governs
the same file for its own topic.

Everything here describes an ordinary session. A session started with `--incognito` keeps none of
it, and reads all of it: [incognito.md](incognito.md) governs which half is which.

## Clauses

<a id="SESSION-1"></a>
### SESSION-1: a session belongs to the directory it ran in

Records live under one directory per working directory, so the list worth seeing when resuming in
one project is not the list from another. Each session is two files: the record, holding what the
picker shows and what a resume needs, and the trail, appended a turn at a time.

A session is named by a version 4 UUID, and the two files are named after it. Random rather than
counted or clocked, so two sessions cannot collide however many are running, and opaque because the
name is printed on a screen and pasted into a command, and a name built from the time and the
process id would put two facts about the machine somewhere they are nobody's business. Nothing
orders sessions by it; the list is sorted on what each record says it was last written.

<a id="SESSION-2"></a>
### SESSION-2: nothing untrusted is ever written down

Every message in the record has already been past the gate that decides what the planner may see,
so what lands on disk is what the planner was allowed to hold: no untrusted bytes, by construction
rather than by filtering. Quarantined content is not written at all, and the trail is labels and
gate names with no content in it.

**Why.** A record is read back into a later turn's context. Anything written that the planner could
not have held would enter that context on the next resume, which is the laundering route the whole
design exists to close.

`verified-by: none`

<a id="SESSION-3"></a>
### SESSION-3: the record carries what a resume needs and nothing more

The conversation, the plan each turn worked to, what the session has spent, the branch it ran on,
the questions asked beside the work, and the standing permissions its user granted. A session can
be named, renaming rewrites the record immediately, a chosen name survives the next turn, and an
empty name is refused.

`verified-by: bravebot_tui::sessions::an_empty_name_is_refused`

<a id="SESSION-4"></a>
### SESSION-4: a title comes from the prompt, and is cut rather than mangled

The first line of what was asked. A long one is cut and says it was, and a prompt with nothing in
it still has a title.

<a id="SESSION-5"></a>
### SESSION-5: everything here degrades to doing nothing

A missing home directory, a full disk, a corrupt record, a stored time in the future: a session
that cannot be written down still runs, one that cannot be read is left out of the list, and a
corrupt history reads as no history rather than as an error.

**Why.** None of this is load bearing for correctness. Failing a turn because a convenience could
not be saved would trade something that matters for something that does not.

<a id="SESSION-6"></a>
### SESSION-6: a submitted prompt is remembered, and a cancelled one is not

Prompts persist across runs and are capped, consecutive duplicates collapse into one, and a prompt
that was cancelled is removed again.

Each is stored with when it was sent and which workspace it was sent from, both of which the search
over the history reads ([terminal-input.md](terminal-input.md#INPUT-20)). A line written before
either was kept is read as a prompt with neither, rather than being dropped or given an invented
time, and is written back out the way it came in.

**Why.** Neither fact can be worked out afterwards: a file's own timestamp says when the newest
prompt was added and nothing about the rest, and a prompt's workspace is gone the moment the session
that sent it ends. Somebody's history is also the one file here whose loss they would notice, so a
format that could not read the previous one would be paid for in exactly the thing this is for.

### SESSION-7: recalling a prompt is a mode, and leaving it restores what was being typed

Up walks backwards from the most recent and stops at the oldest, Down walks forwards again, and
leaving the newest entry puts back the half-written line. Submitting leaves the mode, and a prompt
arriving while browsing does not shift the view.

**Why.** Pressing Up out of curiosity must not destroy a line somebody was part way through
writing.

<a id="SESSION-8"></a>
### SESSION-8: a session says how to pick it up again as it ends

Leaving prints the command that resumes this session, and the id is the one that fetches it. It is
printed after the terminal is handed back, so it stays on the screen the person is left looking at
rather than going with the interface. A session that never wrote a record prints nothing.

A session that changed its working directory says where it went, because an id is looked up under
the directory the command is run in and the shell reading this line never moved. Where the session
ended where it started, the directory goes unsaid: naming the one somebody is standing in reads as
though something had happened to it.

**Why.** A session is worth resuming far more often than anybody thinks to write its name down
beforehand, and the picker is no use to someone who has already closed the window. Naming a
session with no record behind it would be worse than saying nothing: the command would answer "no
session by that name". Naming one in the wrong directory is worse again, because it does not fail:
the same id in the directory left behind is the same session as it was before the move, so the line
would quietly resume work that stops partway.

<a id="SESSION-9"></a>
### SESSION-9: the theme name is stored globally, like the model

Which theme paints the interface is written under `~/.bravebot` and read back at the next start.
It is not a property of a checkout: the same choice applies in every directory, and an empty or
corrupt file is no choice at all, falling back to `brave`. Custom theme files live beside it, under
`~/.bravebot/themes`, which [terminal-transcript.md](terminal-transcript.md) governs.

**Why.** Asking again in every project for the same preference is answering it repeatedly, and
nothing about a theme depends on which files are open.

<a id="SESSION-10"></a>
### SESSION-10: a manifest run is recorded, and cannot be continued

The goal, the proposed plan, the frozen steps, and what each one did are written into the record,
finished or not. The conversation is empty: a session is turns over one conversation, and a
manifest run has none. The picker marks the row and refuses Enter rather than loading an empty
session and asking the model to carry on from nothing. Naming one on the command line prints
what it produced, and still does not continue it.

<a id="SESSION-11"></a>
### SESSION-11: the record says what answered, and what each turn cost

The model the server reported answering with is written down, along with what each turn spent as
well as the total. The breakdown adds up to the total, and a turn that compacted part way through
is charged for that too, since it was asked for in the middle of that turn's work.

The name recorded is the one that answered, not the one asked for: an endpoint may serve something
other than the name it was given, and the record is an account of what happened. A record written
before either was kept reads as no model and an empty breakdown, which is not the same as a
session that cost nothing: the total is still there.

**Why.** A transcript is read after the fact to find out why a session went the way it did, and
both questions are unanswerable from a total alone. Twenty even turns and one turn that ran away
come to the same figure and want different fixes. Two sessions cannot be compared at all without
knowing which model produced each, and a global setting read afterwards is today's answer rather
than the one in force at the time.

`verified-by: bravebot_tui::state::clearing_forgets_what_each_turn_cost`

<a id="SESSION-12"></a>
### SESSION-12: the record says where each turn's time went, not only how long it took

Every turn's wall clock is written down split four ways: what was spent waiting on the model, what
was spent running tools, what was spent waiting for the person to answer a prompt, and what is left
over. The four are a partition rather than four independent measures, so the parts account for the
whole and the remainder is meaningful. An approval prompt is drawn from inside a tool call, so what
was spent waiting for a person is taken off the tool figure rather than counted in both.

A turn that failed is recorded on the same footing as one that succeeded, and a `/compact` asked for
mid-turn is charged to the turn it interrupted, as its tokens are. `/status` reports the session
total and each part that actually happened; a part that did not happen is left out rather than shown
as zero. A record written before this was kept reads as an empty breakdown, which is not the same as
a session that took no time.

**Why.** A duration alone is unactionable, and the three things it conflates want three different
fixes. A turn that took four minutes on the model, one that took four minutes running a test suite,
and one that took four minutes with a diff on the screen while its user was at lunch are the same
number. Only the last is not the machine's fault, and it is the one a total can never reveal:
without a figure of its own, stalled time is indistinguishable from inference, and so is the
harness's own overhead.

<a id="SESSION-13"></a>
### SESSION-13: a session that changes directory is recorded where it moved to

`/cd` moves the record with the working directory, and the session is written there straight away
rather than at the end of the next turn. What was already written stays where it was written: those
turns happened in that directory and are still worth resuming there. A session with nothing written
yet writes nothing, as it does anywhere else, and its destination moves all the same: whatever it
writes later is written where it is working by then.

The trail stays with the turns rather than following the session, since it is appended a turn at a
time beside whichever record was current. A move therefore splits it, and a resume replays the
whole conversation but shows only the gate decisions made in the directory being resumed from. The
conversation does not split: every save writes the whole of it.

**Why.** SESSION-1 keeps one list per working directory, and the record carries the trust map, which
is written in that directory's terms: a relative rule means a path under it. A record left behind
after a move would offer the new directory's answers to somebody resuming in the old one, which is
a yes for a directory nobody was ever asked about. Writing it immediately is what makes the session
resumable in its new home at all: until it is saved there, there is nothing there to find.

<a id="SESSION-14"></a>
### SESSION-14: the session someone was just in can be picked up without naming it

`--continue` takes the most recently written session under the working directory, the one the
picker offers first, and picks it up exactly as naming its id would. A manifest run is passed over
rather than refused, since there is no conversation inside one to carry on from. Where the
directory holds no session that can be continued, it says so and fails rather than starting a fresh
one.

**Why.** An id is the answer to "resume that one", and the question people actually have most of
the time is "carry on with what I was just doing". Answering it with an id means finding the line
that printed one, in a terminal that is often the thing that went away. Starting fresh instead
would be answering a different question by discarding the one asked: an empty transcript is
indistinguishable from a session that was lost, and the way to reach an older one is the picker.

<a id="SESSION-15"></a>
### SESSION-15: the effort level is stored globally, like the model

How hard the model is asked to think is written under `~/.bravebot` and read back at the next
start. It is not a property of a checkout: the same choice applies in every directory, and a blank
file, or one naming a level this program does not define, is no choice at all, leaving the request
to carry none. Asking for no level removes the record rather than writing an empty one, so somebody
who unsets it is back where they were before they ever chose.

**Why.** Asking again in every project for the same preference is answering it repeatedly, and
nothing about how hard to think depends on which files are open. Refusing to store a word this
program does not define is what keeps an edited file from putting an unrecognised level into a
request field.

### SESSION-16: session records and directories are private to the user

On Unix platforms, session directories are created with mode 0700, and session files (records,
temporary files, and audit trails) are written with mode 0600. Existing files and directories
are tightened on write.

**Why.** Per SESSION-3, session records hold the full conversation history, prompts, model
responses, file snippets shown to the planner, and accumulated standing permissions. Without
restricted modes, records land at the default process umask (typically 0644 for files and 0755
for directories), leaving private code, potential secrets, and granted permissions readable by
any local account on multi-user machines and shared hosts.

`verified-by: bravebot_tui::sessions::pre_existing_session_files_and_directories_are_tightened_on_write`

<a id="SESSION-17"></a>
### SESSION-17: a transcript can be written out as markdown, inside the working directory

`/export` writes the recounted transcript to a markdown file, at the path named on the line or at
`bravebot-export-<id>.md`. The path is confined to the working directory the way a workspace write
is: `..`, a root and a drive prefix are refused, and containment is then tested against the
canonical path of the deepest directory that exists, so a path leading through a symlink out of
the tree is refused as well. Anything already at the path is refused rather than replaced, a
symlink whose target is missing included. Missing parent directories are created. The file is
written mode 0600, as SESSION-16 writes the record it came from.

**Why.** The transcript belongs to the person who had the conversation, which
[compaction.md](compaction.md) says in as many words, and without this the only way to exercise
that is to read the record's JSON out of the state directory. The path is typed on the same line
as the command, so it gets the confinement any other path from that line would get; a transcript
carries whatever the session read, and an export that could be steered to an arbitrary path would
be a way to write it anywhere.

<a id="SESSION-18"></a>
### SESSION-18: an interactive session can be forked to explore an alternative path

The `--fork` flag duplicates an existing session into a new session record with its own identifier,
preserving the conversation transcript, spend history, and audit trail while resetting the start
time and marking the title. Manifest runs plan their entire sequence and cannot be forked, matching
the continuation rule in SESSION-10.

**Why.** Exploring an alternative technical path from a shared prefix preserves the expensive
context already built up without polluting the original session. Refusing manifest runs maintains
the invariant that finished autonomous runs have a definite end.

`verified-by: bravebot_tui::sessions::forking_a_manifest_session_is_refused`

<a id="SESSION-19"></a>
### SESSION-19: the last turn can be rewound, on disk and in the conversation together

`/undo` puts the session back where it stood before the most recent turn. Every path that turn
wrote through a file tool goes back to what it held first, and one the turn created is removed.
The conversation returns to its pre-turn snapshot, and with it the turn count, the spend, the
timing, the trust map, the trusted programs, and the transcript. The turn's audit lines are
dropped, since they decided about a turn that is no longer in the conversation. A rewind that
goes back past the session's first turn removes its record rather than leaving one with nothing
in it.

What one turn keeps is bounded. Past that budget a path is still remembered, but what it held is
not, and a rewind treats it as a path that will not go back rather than as a file that was never
there. A path that will not go back is named on the line that reports the rewind, and the rest of
the rewind still happens.

One turn is as far back as it goes, and the window closes when the next turn begins. Anything
else that changes the session outside a turn closes it as well: `/clear`, `/compact`, `/btw`,
`/rename`, `/add-dir`, `/cd`, and a shell-mode command, whose writes the workspace never saw. `/undo` then
says there is nothing left to undo rather than rewinding to a snapshot that describes a different
session.

**Why.** A turn that went wrong is the case with no clean recovery: `git checkout` takes the
user's own uncommitted work with it, and `/clear` throws away the context that was worth keeping.
Disk and conversation move together because either one alone leaves the transcript describing a
tree that is not there, which is worse than neither. A file that would not go back is that same
disagreement, so it is said out loud rather than swallowed: a person told a turn was undone will
not go looking. The budget exists because the cost is paid by every turn that writes anything,
not by the rare one that is rewound; unbounded, one write of a large file would hold it in memory
until the turn after it.

### SESSION-20: a question asked beside the work is recorded, and comes back into the view alone

`/btw` asks something over a copy of the conversation and puts neither half into it. Both halves
are written into the record, and a resume puts them back into the mode Ctrl-L opens, which
[watching.md](watching.md) governs. Nothing reads them into a conversation, so a resumed session
carries on from the exchange it had and not from the questions asked beside it.

The answer is written only where the gate that decides what the planner may hold returned it
visible. Where that gate quarantined it, which is a conversation that has met something untrusted,
the question is recorded and the answer is not. A record written before this was kept reads as a
session with no questions beside it, which is what such a session was.

A session that has had no turn yet writes nothing, as it does anywhere else that writes outside a
turn.

**Why.** The reason for keeping them is that the answer exists nowhere else: it is drawn on one
screen, in one mode, and losing it on a resume would mean a person could only read their own
question once. The reason for keeping only what the planner could have held is SESSION-2: a record
holding more than that is a route into a later turn's context, and an aside is written into the
same file as the conversation.

**Why not into the conversation.** Putting it back would undo the whole of what asking it there
achieved. A person asks beside the work precisely so the digression is not in front of the planner
for the rest of the session, and a resume that folded it in would make `/btw` a turn that took one
run to arrive.

## Known costs

- **Two working directories can share a session store.** The directory name is derived by mapping
  every character outside a small set to `-`, which is lossy, so `/a/b`, `/a-b` and `/a b` all
  reduce to the same name. Nothing re-checks afterwards: the listing reads every record in that
  directory without comparing the path recorded inside it. Since a resume restores standing
  permissions, permissions granted in one of those directories would be offered in another.

  The record does hold the true path, so the fix is to filter on it. `two_directories_do_not_share_a_key`
  does not cover this: it compares `/a/one` with `/a/two`, which differ before the mapping is
  applied.

- **A rewind sees file-tool writes and nothing else.** The backups are taken inside the workspace,
  so a turn that changed a file by running a program instead (`run`, per [run.md](tools/run.md))
  leaves nothing to put back. `/undo` still reports one turn rewound, and the conversation is,
  but that program's changes stay on disk. Covering them would mean snapshotting the tree around
  every command rather than around every write, which is a different and much larger mechanism.

- **A rewind overwrites edits made since the turn.** What goes back is what the path held before
  the turn wrote to it, so a file the user edited themselves in between loses that edit. Nothing
  compares the file against what the turn left there, and nothing asks first.
