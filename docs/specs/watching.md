## Scope

What a person sees of what happened outside the transcript: the delegates a turn started, the
commands it ran, and the questions a person asked beside the work, where their lines go, how much
of them is kept, the mode Ctrl-L opens over them, and what that mode does not offer. What a
delegate is, how many run at once and what crosses back to the planner is
[delegation.md](delegation.md); what a command line may do is
[tools/command-line.md](tools/command-line.md). Nothing here changes either: the subject is what
reaches a screen, not what reaches a model.

What is drawn for the turn itself is [terminal-transcript.md](terminal-transcript.md). Reading
back through what has already happened is [scroller.md](scroller.md), whose keys this mode borrows
rather than inventing a second dialect of.

## Why it exists

A delegate's work is discarded by design: the planner is told a sentence, and the reading, the
commands and the narration behind it end with the delegate. Drawn nowhere, that leaves the person
with a single line about work they cannot see, done in a directory they own.

A command's output has the same shape of problem. The transcript draws the first lines of it and a
count, which is what a line in a sequence has room for, and the rest is drawn nowhere: a person who
owns the directory is left with "12 lines, quarantined" about a program their agent ran there.

Several delegates run at once, so there is no single thing to look at. Each is drawn on the
screen the person is already reading, and the whole of what any one of them is doing is a key
away.

A question asked beside the work is here for the opposite reason. It has no shortage of room in
the transcript: it is kept out of the transcript on purpose, because it is kept out of the
conversation. An aside asked as a prompt would be a turn, read back by every turn after it, and
the digression would be in front of the planner for the rest of the session. Answered here, the
question and its answer are the person's, and this is the one screen they exist on.

## Clauses

<a id="WATCH-1"></a>
### WATCH-1: a delegate's work is drawn under the delegate, and never among the turn's lines

Each one has a block of its own, where the call that started it happened, and what it reads and
runs is drawn inside that block. Nothing of it is drawn in the turn's own sequence.

**Why.** Interleaved, neither sequence can be read: a turn that asked a delegate to run the build
would have the build log in the middle of it, which is the context problem the whole design
exists to avoid, reappearing on the screen. With several delegates running it is also ambiguous,
since two of the same kind produce identical lines and nothing on the row says which run touched
which file.

<a id="WATCH-2"></a>
### WATCH-2: which block a line goes in is what the driver said, never what the line says

A report lands under the delegate the driver named as its author, and under the turn where it
named none. Nothing reads a line to work out whose it is, and where a line arrived in the
sequence decides nothing.

**Why.** A line is prose a model had a hand in. An interface deciding from one which run it
belonged to would be taking that decision from model output, which is the thing this repository
refuses everywhere else. Order cannot stand in for it either: several runs report at once, so the
order lines arrive in is the order the work happened rather than the order it was asked for.

<a id="WATCH-3"></a>
### WATCH-3: the block draws the last few of a delegate's work and counts the rest

Three of its calls are drawn where it started, and a delegate that has made more than three says
how many it has made.

**Why.** The turn's own sequence is what the block sits in, and a delegate that makes thirty calls
would otherwise push the turn off the screen. Three rows without the count read as a delegate
doing very little, which is what the count answers.

<a id="WATCH-4"></a>
### WATCH-4: what the block has no room for is kept, up to a bound

A delegate holds its work beyond the few its block draws, and drops its oldest once it has made
several hundred calls.

**Why.** The block is a glance and the mode is the reading, so keeping only what the block draws
would leave the mode with three rows to show for an hour's work. The bound is there because a
delegate runs as long as a turn does, and this is held in memory for a person who may never look.

<a id="WATCH-5"></a>
### WATCH-5: a delegate that has finished collapses to what the turn was told

Its block ends on the driver's sentence about how the run ended and the report the delegate
answered with, and stops drawing the work behind it. The work is still there to be opened. A
delegate that could not finish answered nothing, so its block carries the sentence alone.

**Why.** What anybody acts on is the conclusion, and a block that stops without saying how it
ended leaves a reader looking at a last tool call, unable to tell an answer from a failure.
Several blocks left open at their last command also spend rows on work that is over.

The sentence alone is not the conclusion. Everything a delegate read and ran ends with it, so the
report is the only thing on the screen that says what the run was for: a delegate asked to pick a
file says which one there and nowhere else, and a round count in its place leaves a person with a
number for work done in a directory they own.

<a id="WATCH-6"></a>
### WATCH-6: a reply a delegate is writing is drawn nowhere

What a delegate writes between its tool calls is not drawn, in its own view or the turn's. Its
conclusion reaches the screen as the report.

**Why.** The turn's own half-written reply is drawn at the tail of the screen. A delegate's
sentence drawn there would read as the planner writing something it never wrote, and the same
sentence drawn in a delegate's view would be the only thing on that screen the delegate did not
do.

<a id="WATCH-7"></a>
### WATCH-7: Ctrl-L opens what happened outside the transcript: the list where there are several rows, the one where there is one

The list is the way in where the view holds more than one row, and where it holds one that row's
own lines are what opens. The view opens on the delegate that is working, and on the last row in
the list where none is.

Where the view holds nothing the key does nothing at all.

The list is a panel over the session, sized to the delegates it holds and never to the screen, and
the transcript stays drawn behind it. A delegate's own lines take the screen. Where there are more
delegates than the panel is tall, the rows drawn are the ones around the highlight.

**Why.** Which row is the question a person has when several runs are going, and a mode that
opened straight into one of them answers a question they did not ask. A list of one is a row to
press through to reach the only thing behind it. A mode that opens on an empty screen is worse
than a key that does not answer: it puts somebody somewhere, with nothing to read and something to
get out of.

The two are different shapes because they are read differently. The list is a question with a
handful of answers, read once, and the transcript behind it is what somebody picking one is
reading: taking the screen for it makes choosing between two delegates cost the whole of what led
up to them. A delegate's own lines are a transcript, scrolled and read for as long as the run
lasts, and a panel is the wrong container for that.

<a id="WATCH-8"></a>
### WATCH-8: a delegate's view opens on what it was asked and closes on what it answered

What is drawn is the delegate's work and none of the turn's. What it was asked to do stands above
its lines, and the sentence the turn was told closes them, with the report under it.

`n` and `p` move between delegates without going back to the list, and stop at each end rather
than wrapping. They stay among the delegates: the session is a row in the list and not a step
here. Coming out puts the turn's own view back where it was left.

**Why.** The view is read by somebody who was not told what the delegate was asked to do, and a
view that stopped at the last call leaves them looking at a command, unable to tell an answer from
a failure. Comparing two runs is what having several is for, and stepping through wants to arrive
at the last one and know that it is the last.

<a id="WATCH-9"></a>
### WATCH-9: the view takes every key, and the way out is read against the nearest level

Nothing falls through to the input box, and the box is not drawn, behind the list's panel or
anywhere else. `q` and Escape go back to the
list from a delegate, and close the mode from the list or where there is no list behind it.
Ctrl-L and Ctrl-C close it from either level and do nothing else. Escape and Ctrl-C reach the mode
before they reach the turn: the turn in flight goes on, and the press that reaches it is the next
one. A summary, an aside and a goal check are read the same way, each being a request the view can
be open over. A goal armed behind a check is not touched either, since the press that closes the
view is not a press about it.

There is no key for talking to a delegate and no box for it. A delegate is given one task, has
nobody to ask, and takes no line typed mid-turn.

**Why.** What a person types while watching would otherwise wait in a line they cannot see, to be
sent to a turn they are not looking at. A person stops the nearest thing, and somebody who went to
look at what a delegate was doing is not asking for the turn to end when they come back out;
watching is also the mode most likely to be open while something is going wrong.

<a id="WATCH-10"></a>
### WATCH-10: what is on the screen changes when a person asks, and not otherwise

A delegate finishing leaves the view on it. A delegate starting does not take the screen from
somebody reading an older one.

**Why.** Several delegates report at once, so a view that followed the newest event would move
under the reader several times a second, and the run somebody opened would be the one run they
could not keep on the screen.

<a id="WATCH-11"></a>
### WATCH-11: the footer speaks in the interface's own words, and the turn's own row names the key

The footer names the kind and the driver's number for it, says whether the delegate is working,
answered or did not finish, and names the way out. Nothing a model wrote is quoted there: what the
delegate was asked stands above the lines, where the conventions for drawing content apply. The
position and the keys for moving between delegates appear only where there is more than one.

The list carries its own title and its own key row, and fills the row that would open edge to
edge rather than marking it.

Once the view has anything to open, the hint line names the key and says how many rows there are,
counting every kind of row together. The key is in the shortcut list. No other row names it,
including the one that reports what the turn is doing.

**Why.** The turn's transcript shows one block and three rows of a delegate, and a preview and a
count of what a command printed, so somebody who does not already know the key has no way to find
out there is anything more to see. The hint line is where that is said because it outlasts the
turn, and what the view holds is most worth opening afterwards: what a delegate leaves behind is a
sentence about work nobody has read. The count is there because a key with nothing behind it does
nothing, and that line is read at a glance.

**Why every kind in one count.** The key opens one list and the count stands for what is in it. A
count of delegates alone leaves a session that ran commands and spawned none with a key that opens
something and no line on the screen saying so, which is the case the hint exists for.

**Why only there.** One key named twice on one screen, once beside the spinner and once at the
foot, reads as two things to press. The line that is always drawn is the one to put it on.

<a id="WATCH-12"></a>
### WATCH-12: none of this reaches a model, and a delegate's work is not written down

A delegate's lines go to a screen and stop there. The planner that asked is told the report and
nothing else, and no delegate is part of the record a session is resumed from, so a resumed
session has no delegates in it. What a command printed is not written down either. Starting a new
conversation forgets both, and the mode standing over any of it closes with them.

An aside is the one row that is written down, and it reaches no model either: the record keeps the
question and the answer, a resume puts them back into this view, and there is no path from the
record into a conversation. What the record may hold is [sessions.md](sessions.md)'s.

**Why.** A screen is not a context. The person owns the directory and may see what their agent
did in it; what must not happen is those lines reaching a planner's context by any route. A
record read back into a later turn is such a route, so a delegate's lines and a command's output
are never written at all: both are content the planner may never have been shown, and neither can
be told apart from the other once it is bytes in a file.

An aside is different in kind rather than by exception. Its question is a line the person typed,
and its answer is only ever written where the gate that decides what the planner may hold said it
could: nothing lands in the record that could not have been in the exchange beside it.

<a id="WATCH-13"></a>
### WATCH-13: a report the planner may not read is drawn in the marked block

Where a delegate's own context met something untrusted, the planner is handed a reference and the
person is shown a preview of the words, in the same margin-marked block every quarantined result
is drawn in. Where the planner was given the words, the person is shown the same words, unmarked.

**Why.** Which of the two a report is was settled by the gate that decided what the planner got,
and the drawing says which happened rather than deciding it. Marking a report the planner read
would claim a confinement that is not there; drawing an unread one plain would hide one that is.

<a id="WATCH-14"></a>
### WATCH-14: the session is the first row of the list, and choosing it goes back to the conversation

The list holds the session above the delegates. The key that opens a row opens it, and what that
does is close the mode and put the turn's own view back where it was left. Moving up from the
first delegate reaches it; moving down from it reaches the first delegate again.

Coming back to the list from a delegate puts the highlight on that delegate rather than on the
session.

**Why.** Every destination the mode can reach is a row, except the one somebody was reading
before they opened it. Leaving was a key on no row, so a person comparing two delegates could
reach either and had nothing on the screen telling them how to get back to what they came from.

**Why the highlight does not start there.** Somebody pressing the key that goes back to the list
asked for the list, not for the way out, and a highlight sitting on the way out turns the next
press of enter into an exit.

<a id="WATCH-15"></a>
### WATCH-15: what a command printed is one of the rows the view opens

Every command a turn ran is a row in the same list, after the delegates and in the order they ran.
Opening one draws what it printed, as far back as is kept, in the shape a delegate's own lines are
drawn in. Where the planner was kept from the output, every row of it carries the margin every
quarantined block carries, and what is not kept is said rather than dropped silently.

A command's row is there whether or not the planner read what it printed, and the row says which.

**Why.** The transcript has room for a preview and a count, and a person who owns the directory is
entitled to the rest: "12 lines, quarantined" does not tell them what their agent just ran. That is
the same reason a delegate has a view, so it is the same list rather than a second key to learn.

**Why after the delegates.** A row's place is what somebody steps through, and a list ordered by
when things happened would move the row under them every time a command finished.

<a id="WATCH-16"></a>
### WATCH-16: the view says which kind of thing it is showing

The header and the footer name it: a delegate by its kind and its number, a command as a command
with the line that ran, an aside as an aside. Stepping from one kind to another changes what they
say. A command's view also says whether the planner read what it printed, and an aside's whether
the record keeps its answer.

**Why.** One list holds all of them, and the keys that move through it do not ask what a row is.
With nothing saying so, stepping from a delegate onto a command reads as the same view showing
different lines, and a person cannot tell work their agent handed on from work it did itself.
Whether the planner read something, or will read it back, is the one thing about it that cannot be
worked out from the bytes.

<a id="WATCH-17"></a>
### WATCH-17: a command's row and its view say how the run ended

The row carries a mark for it, in the same three marks a delegate's row uses: one for a run whose
every stage exited zero, one for a run a stage failed, and the mark of work still going for a run
stopped at the wall-clock limit. The view says it in the driver's words, beside the command, which
for a failure names the step and its code.

It is said from the exit codes and the clock, and never from a byte the program printed.

**Why.** A row that gives only the line count leaves a person unable to tell the build that
passed from the one that failed, and unable to tell either from a run still going: twelve lines of
a failing build look much like twelve lines of a passing one. The view says it as well as the row
because a view opened on a long log draws its last lines, and the verdict is not always in them.

**Why the mark of work still going, for a run that was stopped.** That is what it was doing. A
server told to serve a page prints as it goes and never exits, so [tools/run.md](tools/run.md)
RUN-11 has the limit end the run rather than fail it, and a cross beside it would say something
about the program that is not true.

<a id="WATCH-18"></a>
### WATCH-18: a question asked beside the work is one of the rows the view opens

Every `/btw` is a row in the same list, before the delegates and the commands and in the order
they were asked. Opening one draws the question above the answer, the question in the shape a
prompt is drawn in and the answer in the shape a reply is. The row says whether the record keeps
the answer.

Neither half is anywhere else. Nothing about an aside is drawn among the turn's own lines, because
neither half is in the conversation: the planner has read neither the question nor the answer, and
an exchange drawn in the transcript is one a reader takes the planner to have had.

**Why.** The answer exists nowhere else at all, so a row is not a convenience here: without it the
person would have asked a question and been shown nothing. Both halves are drawn because a
question with no answer under it is half of what somebody came to read, and an answer on its own
stops meaning anything as soon as the list holds two.

**Why before the delegates.** An aside is the only row that survives a resume, so a resumed
session's list is asides alone. Put last, every delegate a later turn spawned would be inserted
above them and move their places; put first, everything the session goes on to do appends after
them.

### WATCH-19: the view opens on an aside the moment it is answered

An answered question puts its own row on the screen, and leaving the mode puts the turn's own view
back where it was left. This is the one thing that opens the mode without a person pressing the
key.

**Why.** WATCH-10 keeps the screen still because the events it is about are a turn's, and a person
reading one delegate did not ask for another to take the screen. An aside is not one of those: the
person typed the question a moment ago, and the press that asked for it came from the input box,
which this mode does not draw. An answer left behind a key they have not been told about is not an
answer.

### WATCH-20: an answer the record cannot hold is said to be on the screen only

Where the gate that decides what the planner may hold quarantined the answer, the person is still
shown it and the view says it is not written down. A resumed aside whose answer the record could
not keep draws the question and says the answer did not come back, rather than drawing nothing
under it.

**Why.** Such an answer exists only for as long as the window is open, and that is worth knowing
while the words are still there to copy rather than on the next resume when they are gone. An
empty screen under a question is worse than either: it reads as a question that was never
answered.

### WATCH-21: a question asks for no cache of the exchange it is asked beside

An aside's request marks its own instructions for caching and marks nothing on the end of the
exchange it carries.

**Why.** A cache write is charged above the fresh tokens it covers, and it buys something only where
a later request sends the same prefix again. A mark would sit at the end of everything the request
holds, which is the question the person typed, and an aside adds nothing to the exchange it was
asked beside, so what the write stored could only be read back by a later question repeating those
words. Nothing sends that prefix again.

**The instructions keep their mark**, being the same bytes every question, which is what marking a
prompt is for. What is given up is a write and no read.

## Known costs

- **A delegate that runs long enough loses its oldest work.** Several hundred calls in, the start
  of a run is gone from the screen, and a person arriving late reads from wherever the bound has
  reached. The alternative is holding the whole of every delegate for the length of a session, for
  a reader who may never open one.

- **A delegate cannot be seen after the session that started it.** The record holds the
  conversation, and a delegate's exchange is deliberately not in it, so resuming brings back the
  report and none of the work behind it.

- **A long report takes the rows it needs.** The block draws the whole of what a delegate
  answered, so a delegate that reports several paragraphs takes several paragraphs of the turn's
  own sequence. Capping it would cut the conclusion, which is the one part of a delegate nobody
  can get back any other way.

- **An aside cannot be asked about.** It is one question and one answer, with no box to follow up
  in: a person who wants to press further asks a second `/btw`, over an exchange that still knows
  nothing of the first. The alternative is a second conversation to hold, resume and shorten, which
  is a session rather than an aside.

- **An aside taken over an untrusted exchange lasts as long as the window.** The answer is the
  planner's own words over a context that has read something untrusted, so the record does not keep
  it and a resume brings back the question alone. Keeping it would put bytes in the record that the
  planner could not have held.

- **The view says what a delegate is doing and not how it is going.** One row changes several
  times a second while a delegate works, and nothing on the screen says whether those calls are
  getting anywhere. The report says, and it says it at the end.
