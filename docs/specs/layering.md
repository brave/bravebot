## Scope

Which crate is allowed to do what. A change to a crate's dependencies or its reach is a change to
this spec.

## Clauses

### LAYER-1: which crate may do what

| Crate | Purpose | Depends on | Constraint |
|---|---|---|---|
| `bravebot-core` | The information-flow kernel: the label lattice, slots, references, capabilities, and every policy gate | none | No I/O, and nothing prints. Owns every decision derived from content, and the only place a declassification witness can be minted |
| `bravebot-agent` | Task execution: the tools and the turn loop | `core`, `aichat`, `bedrock`, `config`, `i18n`, `lsp`, `net`, `sandbox`, `skus` | Carries labelled values and must not inspect them. `exec` stays argv-only, and `shell` runs only a line a person typed |
| `bravebot-net` | The network egress path for everything carrying labelled content | `core` | All agent traffic passes the policy gate here. See the known cost below |
| `bravebot-aichat` | Client for the OpenAI-compatible aichat backend | `core`, `config`, `net`, `signing` | Speaks the wire protocol only, and reaches the network through `net` |
| `bravebot-bedrock` | Client for models on AWS Bedrock | `core`, `aichat`, `config`, `net`, `signing` | Speaks the wire protocol only, and reaches the network through `net`. Runs the AWS CLI to resolve a credential, which is the one subprocess it starts |
| `bravebot-tui` | The interactive terminal interface | `core`, `agent`, `aichat`, `config`, `i18n`, `net`, `sandbox` | Presentation. May display released content, always inside a margin it draws itself. Owns the clipboard and shell mode, both of which are gestures a person made. Owns the terminal itself, so it may read the tty directly to ask the terminal about itself; what comes back describes the terminal and never enters a turn |
| `bravebot-cli` | Command-line entry point | `core`, `agent`, `config`, `i18n`, `net`, `sandbox`, `skus`, `tui` | Presentation. Where nobody can be asked, effects are refused rather than applied unseen |
| `bravebot-mcp` | Model Context Protocol client: the extension boundary for tools | `core`, `net`, `sandbox` | An opaque call erases the routing/content split, so primitives stay native rather than moving behind it |
| `bravebot-lsp` | Language server client: a read-only question about a symbol | `core` | Speaks the protocol only. Asks a closed set of read-only methods and never a name a caller supplies, so a server's own method list cannot widen what this does. Separates a location from the text at it: the type carrying a location holds no text, which is what [tools/lsp.md](tools/lsp.md) rests on |
| `bravebot-sandbox` | OS-level confinement for subprocesses | none | Confines processes running code we did not write. A processor's caller is our own code, so it is not what this confines |
| `bravebot-config` | Environment-derived configuration for the backend | none | The configuration surface, on the same footing as the endpoint and the model. Reads the settings layers, including one a checkout may carry, and hands on rule text without matching a rule. See [backends.md](backends.md) |
| `bravebot-i18n` | Message catalogs for everything a person reads | none | Presentation text only. Holds nothing the planner is sent, and decides nothing: a message is named in the source, so no value can pick one. See [localization.md](localization.md) |
| `bravebot-signing` | Brave services request signing, hs2019 HMAC-SHA256 over the body digest | none | Auth only. Carries no workspace content |
| `bravebot-skus` | Imports a Leo Premium subscription by registering as a new device | none | Auth only. Carries no workspace content and no model output. Keeps its own HTTP client, over a transport its caller states. See [premium-credentials.md](premium-credentials.md) |

### LAYER-2: `bravebot-core` and `bravebot-agent` are both the driver

Relocating a decision from one into the other does not remove it. A branch on untrusted bytes is
a violation wherever it sits.

**Why.** The dependency graph makes `core` look like the safe place to put things, and it is not.
The kernel is where decisions derived from content are *taken*, not where they become allowed.

`verified-by: none`

<a id="LAYER-3"></a>
### LAYER-3: presentation crates display untrusted content on purpose

`bravebot-tui` and `bravebot-cli` show quarantined content to the person watching. A terminal is
not a context, and an agent that will not say which file it is working on has protected nobody.
Everything shown is marked with a margin the renderer draws, and has its control characters
replaced, so the content cannot draw its own.

<a id="LAYER-4"></a>
### LAYER-4: a crate root says what it does about unsafe

Every crate root declares `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`, or `#![deny(unsafe_code)]` with an
`#[allow(unsafe_code)]` at each site that needs one. A library, a binary and a build script are
each a crate root, and a `cfg(test)` module is part of the crate it sits in, so an `unsafe` block
there is one of the crate's own and is named the same way.

**Why.** Nearly every crate here contains no `unsafe` at all. Undeclared, that is a property
nothing records: it holds by accident, and the first `unsafe` to arrive arrives silently. Declared,
the compiler decides it, and what a reviewer reads is the sites that name themselves rather than
every crate in the workspace. Two crates name sites: `bravebot-sandbox`, whose landlock syscalls
are its reason for existing, and `bravebot-skus`, whose tests point `HOME` at a scratch directory.
Taking `deny` where `forbid` would do is the way the rule is kept in letter and lost in substance,
because `deny` is the one an `allow` added later reopens.

`verified-by: bravebot_cli::unsafe_code::allowing_unsafe_at_a_root_is_not_a_declaration`

## Known costs

- **A crate root says nothing about the test binaries beside it.** A file under `tests/` is its
  own crate that no root attribute reaches, so the `unsafe` in `bravebot-agent`'s and
  `bravebot-tui`'s test helpers sits outside what LAYER-4 decides. Nothing in such a file ships,
  and covering them would take an attribute per file with nothing to keep a new file honest, which
  is the accident LAYER-4 exists to remove.

- **`bravebot-net` is not the only crate that opens a socket.** `bravebot-skus` builds its own HTTP
  client and talks to Brave's subscription service directly, without putting anything to the policy
  gate. That traffic carries credentials and an order id, never workspace
  content or model output, so no labelled value escapes the gate. LAYER-3 is worded as "all agent
  traffic" for that reason. A second egress that ever carried content would be a violation. What
  that client trusts and what it goes through is not its own: `register` is handed a transport
  configuration by the caller, which is `bravebot-agent` or `bravebot-cli` and depends on
  `bravebot-net` already. That is the one thing about the two clients that must not differ
  ([NET-7](network-egress.md#NET-7), [NET-8](network-egress.md#NET-8)), since a machine states one
  certificate authority and one route off it, not one per client. Passing it in rather than
  depending on `bravebot-net` keeps this crate at no dependencies, which is what makes "auth only"
  checkable by reading its manifest.
