## Scope

Recording the planner's own plan. `todos` is content, and there is no routing at all. The result is
a confirmation.

## Clauses

<a id="TODO-1"></a>
### TODO-1: there is no routing, because nothing is touched

The plan is shown to the user and reaches nothing else. It is the one tool with no destination.
The call holds no capability, decides no destination, and touches no path.

<a id="TODO-2"></a>
### TODO-2: an unrecognised status reads as outstanding work

A task is struck through only when it is finished, and anything the driver does not recognise
counts as unfinished.

**Why.** Showing work as done on the strength of a word nobody recognised would misreport what
happened.
