## Scope

Finding lines in the workspace that match a pattern. `pattern`, `directory`, `include`, `offset` and
`case_sensitive` are routing: the first three name where to look and what to look for, the offset
names which page of the matches to return, and the flag decides which of the lines there match.
There are no content arguments. The result is the matching lines, or a reference.

## Clauses

<a id="SEARCH-1"></a>
### SEARCH-1: the pattern is a regular expression, matched without backtracking

Supported: literals, `.`, `*`, `+`, `?`, `|`, `(...)`, `[...]` with ranges and negation, `\d`,
`\w`, `\s` and their negations, `^`, `$`, `\b`, `\B`, and a backslash before a metacharacter to
match it literally.

Counted repetition (`a{2,9}`) is absent and `{` is an ordinary character. Backreferences are
absent. Captures are not extracted: a search reports the line, so whether the pattern matched is
the whole question.

`pattern` may be a list, and a line matching any of them matches. That is one more expression to
try per line, so the work is the sum of the patterns rather than a power of anything.

Case folding is done by the engine, never by lowercasing the pattern, which would rewrite `\D`,
`\W` and `\S` into the classes they negate and invert what the search asked for.

**Why.** A pattern arriving through a turn is attack surface, and the danger is catastrophic
backtracking rather than regular expressions as such: `(a+)+$` costs exponential time on a
backtracking engine and nothing unusual on one that does not backtrack. The engine simulates an
NFA, advancing a set of states one character at a time, so matching costs the length of the line
times the size of the pattern whatever the pattern is. Counted repetition is the one construct
that would break that bound, because nesting two multiplies the states a short pattern expands
to, and backreferences are not regular at all: matching one needs the backtracking this rules out.

Hand-written rather than a dependency, for the reason the conventions give.

Brace groups in `include` are **expanded before the walk**, not matched during it. Each alternative
is an ordinary pattern applied once per path, so a group costs a multiple of the work rather than a
power of it, and an expansion past the cap falls back to matching the pattern literally.

<a id="SEARCH-2"></a>
### SEARCH-2: a result touching several files is trusted only if every one of them is

Otherwise it is quarantined whole. Unlike a listing, a search returns one reference for the whole
result rather than one per hit, so its hits are not addresses.

`verified-by: none`

<a id="SEARCH-3"></a>
### SEARCH-3: a truncated search tells the planner it is incomplete

A complete one makes no such claim, so the planner can tell the difference between "nothing more"
and "nothing more shown".

Every cap counts: one that stopped at the limit on matches, one that stopped before it had opened
every file, and one that ran out of time are equally partial. The last two are the more dangerous,
because with nothing found there is nothing to look incomplete. The claim reaches the planner
whether or not it may read the result, since a notice written inside a body the planner is never
shown tells it nothing.

The file cap is set for a search rather than for a listing, and far above it. A listing's paths are
the answer and each one is spent on context; a search's paths are never shown, and only matching
lines are, which have a cap of their own. Holding a search to a listing's budget bought no context
back and cost whole subtrees.

Which files a capped search kept must not depend on the order the filesystem handed them over. A
walk sorts each directory and takes its own files before descending, so a partial answer is the
same partial answer on every machine and is the shallow part of the tree rather than a scattering
through it.

<a id="SEARCH-4"></a>
### SEARCH-4: a pattern that will not compile is reported as such, never as an empty result

The pattern is compiled before any file is opened, and a failure names what is wrong with it.

**Why.** The two answers mean opposite things. Reported as nothing found, a syntax error reads as
proof the tree holds no match, and a planner that believes that stops looking: whole rounds went
on rephrasing patterns against a matcher that never ran them. This is the same reason a truncated
search says it is truncated, for the answer that looks most like a complete one.

Compiling first is also what keeps the report free of anything read: the pattern is routing the
planner proposed, so saying why it will not compile discloses nothing about the workspace.

### SEARCH-5: an empty result says whether anything was searched

A search whose `include` selected no files reports that, and says so instead of reporting no
matches. One that read files and found nothing reports no matches, as before.

A search left with nothing to read because a permission rule covers what it selected reports the
rule, and says that retrying is not the answer. The rule is stated, never which paths it reached:
the names are what it is keeping back. See [permissions.md](../permissions.md).

**Why.** The two are opposite facts wearing the same sentence. Files were read and the pattern was
not in them, which is evidence about the tree. Or nothing was read at all, which is evidence about
the query and says nothing whatever about the tree. Rendered identically, a planner cannot tell
them apart, and the failure is not hypothetical: a real turn wrote `**/*.{cc,h,mm}` when brace
groups were unsupported, got "(no matches)", retreated to `**/*.cc`, and answered the question
wrong because the files it needed were the two extensions it had just dropped.

**Why the rule is a third answer.** A glob that selected nothing is a query to rewrite, and a rule
is not: no spelling reaches past one. Reported as the first, it sends the planner through rounds of
globs against a refusal none of them can satisfy, which is the same failure as the brace group and
costs more, because there is no spelling that ends it.

Where the glob also leans on syntax the matcher does not have, the result says which, for the same
reason [SEARCH-4](#SEARCH-4) reports a pattern that will not compile and against the same failure.
Advice is decided from the glob, which the planner proposed and the routing gate vouched for; the
result decides only whether there was anything to advise about.

### SEARCH-6: case sensitivity is asked for, never inferred

A search matches case exactly unless `case_sensitive` is false. Nothing about the pattern widens
it, and a line is reported as it is written rather than as it was folded to match.

**Why.** A search that quietly widened itself would report matches whose reason the caller cannot
see. The alternative to offering the flag is worse than either: a planner that cannot ask for it
mangles the pattern instead, and a real turn searched for `olicy` to get around a capital `P`. That
finds the word it wanted and every other word ending in those letters, with nothing in the result
to say so.

### SEARCH-7: vendored and generated directories are not walked

A fixed list of directory names is skipped: version control, build output, caches, and dependencies
fetched or vendored. This is size hygiene applied to **names**, and nothing is read to decide it.

**Why.** A tree that mirrors its dependencies holds far more of them than of its own code, so a
walk that counts them reaches its cap without reaching the project. A real search for a common word
spent its entire budget inside a Rust crate mirror and reported documentation comments about the
wrong meaning of the word.

The project's own `.gitignore` would generalise better and is deliberately not used. It would
decide what to walk from the contents of a file in the tree being walked, and a tree that can hide
its own files from a search is a tree that can hide them from review. The names on the list are
ones no project uses for its own sources, so skipping them needs nobody's word for it.

<a id="SEARCH-8"></a>
### SEARCH-8: a search stopped by the match cap says where to continue from

The result gives the offset of the first match left behind, and a further search asking for that
offset returns the matches from there.

Only the match cap can be asked past. A walk that stopped short of the tree or ran out of time
reached neither the end of the matches nor a count of them, so it offers no later page and asks for
a narrower search as before.

An offset past the last match returns nothing and says how many matches there were, so that an
empty page cannot be read as the pattern having gone from the tree between two calls. A pattern that
is nowhere in the tree is an ordinary empty result at every offset: there is no page behind it to
say is still there.

Both of those reach the planner whether or not it may read the result, for the reason
[SEARCH-3](#SEARCH-3) gives about a notice written inside a body nobody is shown. A search is
quarantined by default, so a contract that held only for a trusted workspace would hold for the
minority of them.

**Why.** Narrowing the pattern or dropping to a subdirectory is otherwise the only way past the cap,
and it is a guess about where the matches that were cut off are. A guess that misses drops exactly
those, and nothing in the narrower result says so: it comes back complete, which reads as the whole
answer. A common word in a large tree then has as many matches as the cap allows that can be read
and an unknown number that cannot. This is the paging [read-file.md](read-file.md) gives a long
file, applied to a long list of matches.

The walk is repeated rather than resumed. A search holds no state between calls and visits files in
a fixed order, so counting to the offset again reaches the same match. A cursor would have to
survive between turns and still mean something after the tree changed underneath it. Reading every
file again is the cost of not keeping one.
