## Scope

Writing a whole file. `path` and `contents_ref` are routing; `contents` is content. The result is a
confirmation.

## Clauses

<a id="WRITE-1"></a>
### WRITE-1: contents or a reference, never both

`contents_ref` names quarantined content that becomes the whole file. It is **routing**, since it
decides which bytes the write carries, and it is a name the driver handed out rather than anything
derived from content.

Exactly one of the two. Both would leave the driver choosing between text the planner wrote and
bytes nobody has read, and neither names anything to write, so both shapes are refused before
anyone is asked to approve a write.

**Why.** The worst a wrong reference can do is put the wrong quarantined bytes into a path that
still had to be endorsed on its own.

<a id="WRITE-2"></a>
### WRITE-2: a reference that names no file is not a destination

Everything a processor produced is such a reference. That refusal is what stops untrusted text
choosing where an effect lands.

<a id="WRITE-3"></a>
### WRITE-3: the planner never chooses a destination on its own

A write needs a person's approval, which mints a single-use endorsement bound to that exact path,
so it cannot be replayed or redirected. Where nobody can be asked, writes are refused rather than
applied unseen.

**Why.** The wrong file destroys work rather than wasting a step.

<a id="WRITE-4"></a>
### WRITE-4: a write through a reference is always shown

Even where the trust map would not ask. The person approving is shown the path.

**Why.** The approval is the only moment the filename is visible to anybody. They own the
directory and are the only party who can say whether that file should be rewritten.
