## Scope

Which tools exist, and which of each call's arguments are routing and which are content. Each tool
has a spec of its own, linked from the table.

## Clauses

<a id="TOOL-1"></a>
### TOOL-1: every argument is routing or content, and the split is fixed here

Routing decides what a tool touches and must be trusted and public. Content is merely carried and
may be untrusted. No argument is both, and nothing at run time reclassifies one.

| Tool | Routing arguments | Content arguments | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| [`read_file`](read-file.md) | `path`, `path_ref`, `offset`, `limit` | none | the lines, or a reference |
| [`list_files`](list-files.md) | `directory`, `pattern`, `depth` | none | the paths, or a reference per entry |
| [`search`](search.md) | `pattern`, `directory`, `include` | none | matching lines, or a reference |
| [`lsp`](lsp.md) | `operation`, `path`, `line`, `character` | none | locations, with their text shown or referenced |
| [`write_file`](write-file.md) | `path`, `path_ref`, `contents_ref` | `contents` | confirmation |
| [`edit_file`](edit-file.md) | `path`, `path_ref`, `replace_all` | `old_text`, `new_text` | confirmation |
| [`spawn_processor`](spawn-processor.md) | `reads`, `about` | `instruction` | a reference |
| [`spawn_agent`](spawn-agent.md) | `kind` | `task`, `each` | one report per delegate |
| [`run`](run.md) | every stage's program and arguments, `directory` | standard input | a reference |
| [`read_output`](read-output.md) | the reference naming the result | none | the bytes, if a person allows it |
| [`job_output`](run.md#RUN-15) | `job`, `kill`, `wait_seconds` | none | what it has printed since the last look |
| [`fetch_url`](fetch-url.md) | `url` | none | a reference |
| [`load_skill`](load-skill.md) | `name` | none | the skill's text |
| [`todo_write`](todo-write.md) | none | `todos` | confirmation |
| [`schedule_next`](schedule-next.md) | `delay_seconds`, `noop` | `reason` | the wait that will happen |
| [`ask_user`](ask-user.md) | `questions` | none | what the user answered |

Reads return content when it is trusted and a reference when it is not. Writes are silent or shown
according to the trust map.

`lsp` is the one tool whose result is split across both footings rather than being one or the other:
a location is structure and is reported whatever the trust map says, while the text at that location
is content and is quarantined when it is untrusted. [LSP-3](lsp.md#LSP-3) is where that is settled,
and it is the only place in these specs where a path reaches the planner without having been
vouched for.

`spawn_agent`'s `task` and `each` are the content arguments that may not be untrusted. It decides no
destination, so it is not routing, but it becomes a second planner's prompt rather than a payload
something carries, and a planner's context holds nothing untrusted.
[delegation.md](../delegation.md) is where that is settled.

### TOOL-2: before adding a tool, ask what its routing field is

If a person could not approve that field alone, the tool does not get built. A shell string is
destination and payload at once, which is why the planner has no shell and why `apply_patch` is
excluded. An argument vector passes the test, which is why running a pipeline of stages does not.

`verified-by: none`
