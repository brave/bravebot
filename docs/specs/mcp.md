## Scope

Tools that come from outside this repository, over stdio or HTTP. What such a server returns, what
it is allowed to do, and why the tools bravebot ships are not built this way. Confinement of a
stdio server is [sandboxing.md](sandboxing.md).

## Why the built-in tools stay native

An MCP call is opaque: the whole call goes out and a result comes back. That erases the split
between the part of a call that decides where it lands and the part that is merely carried, which
the built-in tools depend on, since a path is one and a file's contents are the other. A primitive
that needs its parts labelled separately stays native rather than moving behind this boundary.

## Clauses

### MCP-1: what a server returns is untrusted

A tool result is content from outside, so it is labelled untrusted and quarantined like anything
else nobody vouched for. Nothing a server says about itself changes that, a result it marks as its
own failure included.

<a id="MCP-2"></a>
### MCP-2: a call needs the capability, like any other effect

A tool call without the capability granted is refused, so adding a server does not widen what the
agent may do.

<a id="MCP-3"></a>
### MCP-3: a stdio server is not launched without confinement

If the process cannot be confined it is not started, rather than started unconfined.

**Why.** A stdio server runs code we did not write, which is precisely the case an
operating-system boundary exists for.

<a id="MCP-4"></a>
### MCP-4: bravebot advertises no capabilities of its own to a server

The handshake offers nothing, so a server cannot ask this process to do anything on its behalf.

### MCP-5: a failure is reported, never treated as an empty result

A server error, a tool-level error, and a server that exits early are all reported as failures. A
reply carrying no JSON is nothing rather than an empty success.

**Why.** An error read as "no results" would have the planner conclude a thing does not exist when
the truth is that nobody asked successfully.

### MCP-6: only text content is taken from a result

Non-text content is ignored rather than guessed at, and several text parts are joined.

### MCP-7: the transport is parsed strictly

A request carries the protocol version, a notification has no id, and an HTTP reply framed as
server-sent events is unwrapped with the last payload winning.

<a id="MCP-8"></a>
### MCP-8: what a failing tool says about itself is shown to a person and to nobody else

A failure carries the server's account of why the call failed as labelled content, and the
failure's own text names the tool and nothing the server sent. Reading that account takes the
release that puts content on a screen, so it reaches the person watching and never a message the
planner is sent.

**Why.** An error's text is the part of a failure a caller formats into whatever it is building,
including a message the planner is sent, which is the context a hostile tool result exists to
reach. Discarding the account instead would leave a tool failure the only failure here that says
nothing about what went wrong, and what went wrong is usually a person's own server.

### MCP-9: a stdio server is started with no environment

The environment this process holds is emptied before a server starts, on every platform.

**Why.** A server is code we did not write, and a credential this process authenticates with sits
in a variable rather than in a file, so confinement over paths withholds none of it. A program
`run` starts keeps the rest of the environment because a person typed the line and it is meant to
behave as their own terminal does ([tools/run.md](tools/run.md)); nobody types a server, so there
is no such expectation to meet here. Emptying it where the server is launched rather than leaving
it to whichever backend confines the process is what makes the answer the same on both platforms.

**A known cost.** A server that reads a variable to work at all is one that does not work: a
command resolved through `PATH`, and a server wanting a token of a person's own, are both left to
whatever names variables for a server when servers are reachable from something
(issue #83).
