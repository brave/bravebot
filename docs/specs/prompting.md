## Scope

Every moment the system stops and puts something to a human: what the prompt must show, what an
answer grants, and what one answer must never be taken for. `ask_user`, where the **planner** asks
a question, is [tools/ask-user.md](tools/ask-user.md) and is a different thing: these prompts are the system asking
permission.

There are seven: the startup trust question, a directory a settings file asked for, a read of a file
nobody vouched for, a write or edit, a run, reading what a run printed, and the plan a manifest run
is about to walk.

The last is the only one about a whole run rather than about one thing at the moment it is due. It
can be, because that mode fixes every step while the task string is still the only input
([manifest.md](manifest.md#MANIFEST-10)). Everything below applies to it as it does to the rest.

## What every prompt owes the reader

<a id="PROMPT-1"></a>
### PROMPT-1: a prompt shows what is actually at stake, not a summary of it

A write prompt shows the path and the body; an overwrite shows what it replaces; a run prompt
shows the argv, the resolved binary and the directory; an output prompt shows the bytes and the
command that printed them; the prompt about a directory a settings file asked for shows the path it
would open. A person cannot endorse a routing field they were not shown.

The plan prompt shows the task in the person's own words and then every step, in order, each naming
its tier, what it would do, and every routing field the step fixes rather than the headline one
alone. Every step, never a count and never the first few: one answer covers all of them, and the
step below the fold is as binding as the first.

<a id="PROMPT-2"></a>
### PROMPT-2: a prompt says what approving does, and what it does not

The run prompt says it is not sandboxed, asks for the side effects and the output together, and
names the exact command it would vouch for. The output prompt says
what approving does. The trust prompt explains the consequence and names both answers. The prompt
about a directory a settings file asked for says that opening it grants reach and trust, and that a
file asked for it. The plan prompt says that nothing the run reads can add a step, drop one, or send
anything anywhere the plan does not already name; that approving the plan is not approving its
writes, which are each still put to the person as they come up; and that nothing has happened yet, so
declining leaves everything as it is.

**Why.** The second half of a run grant, that what the command prints becomes trusted, is the one
nothing else would tell the user. A directory nobody typed is the same problem in the other
direction: without the question saying where the name came from, the box is unexplained. A plan is
the same problem at its largest, since a reader has no way to tell from a step list how much of the
run one keypress settles.

<a id="PROMPT-3"></a>
### PROMPT-3: what a prompt shows is drawn inside a margin it cannot forge

Content in a prompt is untrusted like any other. An untrusted body is marked as such,
and command output is drawn inside the margin.

A manifest plan's steps are the one body here drawn without a bar, and the reason for the rule is
what says so: they are the driver's own rendering of a plan that came from a context holding the task
string and the driver's own words, and nothing a step read exists yet. A bar down them would mark as
untrusted the one thing on the screen that is not, which is the opposite of why they can be shown.

The margin is on every **drawn row**, not every line of the content. A command's output is
untrimmed and a hunk of a body has no width cap, so a line wider than the prompt box is ordinary
rather than exotic: it is broken to the box's width by the same step that draws the margin, and
each row it breaks into carries a bar of its own. A continuation row that started at column 0 would
be untrusted content outside the margin, placed where the content's own padding chose, near enough
to paint a bar of its own in the margin column. What does not fit vertically is scrolled to rather
than dropped, as it is for any long body.

### PROMPT-4: a review stays legible, or says it could not

A long body keeps the question on screen and offers the rest, which can be scrolled to. A small
edit in a large file shows only the change. An empty output says so, and so does a file with
nothing to preview. A diff that cannot be computed says so rather than showing nothing. A plan longer
than the box is scrolled to rather than cut short, and the question stays on screen while it is.

**Why.** Reviewing a whole file body on a terminal is not review, which is why `edit_file` exists
on a passage rather than a whole body. A prompt that scrolled the question away would be collecting a keypress, not a decision.

## What an answer means

<a id="PROMPT-5"></a>
### PROMPT-5: one answer is never taken for another

An approved write does not approve a run, and does not approve the plan a write is in. A write
approval is not an answer to a question, and an answer to a question is not consent to a write. Each
endorsement is single-use and bound to the exact value it was given for.

**Why.** These are separate grants that happen to use the same keyboard. The plan is the widest of
them, so it is the one where taking another answer for it would run the most that nobody was shown.

<a id="PROMPT-6"></a>
### PROMPT-6: standing permission needs its own key, and is never the default

The run prompt separates running once from running always, Enter does not approve a run, and a run
releasing private data offers no standing permission at all. Declining, and Ctrl-C, vouch
for nothing.

A third answer, whose grant outlives the session, is [tools/run.md](tools/run.md)'s. Everything
above holds of it: it has a key of its own, Enter does not reach it, a run
releasing private data does not offer it, and declining or Ctrl-C records nothing. Its row is where the
two standing lifetimes are told apart, since a key saying only `always` is the one that could be read
as either.

The plan prompt offers no standing form at all, and Enter does not approve a plan either. A plan is
written afresh for each run, so remembering an answer to one would be approving steps nobody has
seen.

<a id="PROMPT-7"></a>
### PROMPT-7: declining is not cancelling

Saying no to a write does not stop the turn; Ctrl-C refuses it and does. Leaving at a question a
session opens with ends the session and opens nothing, and only Ctrl-C leaves.

**Why.** A refusal the agent can carry on past is how a person steers without starting over.

<a id="PROMPT-8"></a>
### PROMPT-8: a resume restores standing permissions, and nothing else

Three of these grants are standing. Two, the trust map
and the list of commands a person said to stop asking about, are written into the session record and
come back with `--resume`, because the person resuming is the person who gave them; a fresh session
in the same directory restores neither and asks again. The third is not restored by a resume at all:
the record of command lines somebody asked to be remembered past the session, which
[tools/run.md](tools/run.md) governs, is read by every session begun in that directory, resumed or
fresh. It reaches a fresh session because the key that made it said how long its answer lasts, and
because what it carries is the asking rather than any trust.

Nothing else survives. A single-use endorsement is created by one approval, is bound to one value,
and is never written down, so a resumed turn cannot replay a write or a run that an earlier turn
was allowed. Answers to the planner's own questions are remembered only in the live session, so a
resumed session puts them again.

**Why.** A standing permission is a decision about the future that its owner made deliberately. An
endorsement is a decision about one act that has already happened, and reviving one would be
approving something nobody looked at.

<a id="PROMPT-9"></a>
### PROMPT-9: where nobody can be asked, the answer is no

A one-shot run refuses effects rather than applying them unseen, and declines every question
rather than inventing an answer. A closed channel refuses a run and answers no
question. A plan is refused too, so a manifest run with nobody to ask stops before its first step
rather than walking a program nobody read.

A person may answer these seven in advance, for a session or for a run, by choosing a mode:
[permission-modes.md](permission-modes.md) is what each mode answers and what asking for one costs.
That is somebody's own standing answer rather than a default, and no mode answers a question the
planner posed, since that asks for information rather than consent.

<a id="PROMPT-10"></a>
### PROMPT-10: a prompt's own chrome is wholly the theme's

Every cell a prompt's border encloses carries the theme's background and its text colour, whatever
is drawn over them. A prompt that painted only its border is a hole in the palette, since clearing
the cells under a panel empties them without colouring them.

**Why.** The boundary between what the system is asking and what somebody else's bytes say is what
a person reads when they answer, and a frame half in the theme and half in the terminal's own
colours is a weaker one. Text that sets no colour of its own is otherwise the terminal's default,
which under a light theme in a dark terminal is the path to unreadable.
