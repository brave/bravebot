## Scope

The `!` prompt: a line the user typed, run through a real shell. It is not a tool and the planner
cannot reach it. The planner's own path for running a program is
[tools/run.md](tools/run.md), and is a different thing entirely.

## Why this is not a hole in the shell exclusion

Read the exclusion precisely. It is not "shell strings are dangerous bytes". It is that a person
cannot endorse a routing field a shell string does not have, and the reason one must be endorsed
is that the string came from the **planner**, which an attacker may have steered. Provenance is
what the rule is about, so a line the user typed is outside it.

## Clauses

<a id="SHELL-1"></a>
### SHELL-1: `!` on an empty prompt runs the line through `$SHELL -c`

Globs, `$VAR`, redirection, `&&` and `$(...)` all work as they do in the user's terminal. The
marker is a mode rather than a character: the prompt changes colour, backspace or escape leaves,
and the mode lasts one command. `$SHELL` falls back to a POSIX shell when unset. An empty line is
not run.

<a id="SHELL-2"></a>
### SHELL-2: nothing asks

The approval prompt exists so a person endorses argv the **planner** proposed. Here the person is
the one it would have asked, so confirming their own keystroke would be theatre. `! rm -rf build`
simply runs.

<a id="SHELL-3"></a>
### SHELL-3: the output is `(T,priv)` and reaches the planner in full

Not as a reference. This is the difference from a program the planner ran itself: after
`! cargo test` the user can say "fix the first failure" and the planner has already read the
errors. Output from a failing command reaches it too, since that is where the explanation is. A
cancelled command records nothing.

This is a first label from provenance, exactly like the label on a program's output or on the
user's own configuration. It is admissible for the reason a vouched-for command is: a person took
responsibility, and nothing inspected anything.

<a id="SHELL-4"></a>
### SHELL-4: only a line a human typed

Never argv the planner proposed, never text read from a file, never anything a processor produced,
never a line reconstructed from a transcript.

**Why.** The justification cannot be checked from the bytes, so it lives at the call site. Today
that is the TUI's shell mode and nothing else.

<a id="SHELL-5"></a>
### SHELL-5: the planner gets no shell tool, ever

Not behind a capability, not behind an approval prompt, not via MCP. If it could ask for one,
everything above is void.

## Known costs

- **A paste into an armed command line is bytes the person did not type reaching the shell.** The
  text lands in the line verbatim, and a line put away comes back into an armed mode as the command
  being written, which is what [terminal-input.md](terminal-input.md) settles for the key that puts
  a line away and brings it back. What Enter asserts is the line in the box, which the person armed
  the mode for and is looking at, and that is the same assertion they make for a command typed one
  character at a time. What the mode may never do is arm itself, since then nobody chose to run
  anything at all.
- **`! cat notes-from-a-stranger.md` puts somebody else's words into the planner's context as
  though they were the user's.** Nothing inspects the bytes to catch that, exactly as nothing
  inspects a directory that was vouched for. It is the same assertion a person makes by vouching for a
  command at a run prompt, made once for one command. If the user would not press `a` for it, they should ask the agent to `run` it
  instead and have the output quarantined.
