//! Wire types for the Converse API as Bedrock serves it, and the translation to and from the shapes
//! the rest of this agent speaks.
//!
//! The body is the one Bedrock states for every provider it hosts rather than any single provider's
//! own, so which model a request names decides nothing about how it is built. What a provider
//! defines for itself travels in the passthrough field the service hands to the model unread.
//!
//! The agent's conversation is held in OpenAI-compatible types, because that is what the other
//! backend speaks. This module converts, in one place, rather than teaching the turn loop two
//! protocols. The differences that matter:
//!
//! - The system prompt is a top-level field, not a message with a role.
//! - Tool calls and their results are content blocks inside user and assistant turns, not a
//!   separate role with an id alongside.
//! - Arguments arrive as a JSON object, not as a string holding one.
//! - Usage counts `inputTokens` and `outputTokens` rather than prompt and completion.
//! - A streamed event is named in its frame's headers, not in a field of its own body.
//!
//! Nothing here inspects content to make a decision. Text is moved between shapes and handed on with
//! whatever label it arrived under.
