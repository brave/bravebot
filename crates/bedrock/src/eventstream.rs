//! The binary framing a streamed Bedrock reply arrives in.
//!
//! Not server-sent events. Bedrock wraps each event in an AWS event-stream frame: a length prelude,
//! a set of typed headers, a payload, and two CRCs. The payload is the event's JSON, and which event
//! it is is a header rather than a field of the body.
//!
//! ```text
//! [total_len:u32][headers_len:u32][prelude_crc:u32][headers][payload][message_crc:u32]
//! ```
//!
//! Decoded by hand for the same reason the rest of this crate is: the alternative is the AWS SDK, a
//! very large dependency for one frame format, and the format is a length and two checksums.
//!
//! # Nothing here decides anything
//!
//! This finds where a frame begins and ends and reads the name the framing gave it, which is
//! transport structure, exactly like the SSE decoder the other backend uses. The bytes inside are
//! handed on with the label they arrived under. The CRCs are checked because a frame that fails one
//! is a frame that was corrupted in transit, and reading a truncated length as a real one would mean
//! waiting forever for bytes that are not coming.
