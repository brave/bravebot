//! A real language server, asked a real question.
//!
//! Everything else about this crate is pinned without a process: parsing is a pure function and the
//! lifecycle rules are properties of the bookkeeping. What none of that reaches is whether the
//! framing, the handshake, the progress tokens and the result shapes are right about a server that
//! actually exists, which is exactly where a protocol client is usually wrong.
//!
//! Skipped rather than failed where the binary is absent, because LSP-6 says that is a legitimate
//! state of the world and not a broken test. A skip prints why, so a run that quietly tested nothing
//! does not read as a pass.
