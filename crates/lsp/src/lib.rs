//! Language server client: positions in, locations out.
//!
//! What makes this admissible where a shell is not is the shape of a request. An operation from a
//! closed set, a path, and two integers: all routing, no payload, nothing a person could not
//! approve on its own. [tools/lsp.md] is the spec, and LSP-3 is the clause to read first, because
//! the interesting part is not the request but the answer.
//!
//! An answer is split in two, and the split is visible in the types here. A [`protocol::Location`]
//! is structure: a path, a line, a character, a symbol kind, read off the server's index. It has
//! nowhere for prose to sit, deliberately, and that is what lets it reach the planner whatever the
//! trust map says about the file it names. Hover text is the other half: bytes the file chose, so it
//! is labelled from the trust map and quarantined like anything else nobody vouched for.
//!
//! This is native rather than an MCP server for the reason [mcp.md] gives: a call whose parts must
//! be labelled separately cannot go behind a boundary that labels the whole thing at once.
//!
