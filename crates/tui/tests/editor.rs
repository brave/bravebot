//! Taking the prompt through a real editor.
//!
//! `$VISUAL` and `$EDITOR` are process-wide, so these tests are the only ones in the crate that
//! touch them and they are kept in a file of their own, in the same arrangement `HOME` gets.
//!
//! The editors here are ordinary programs standing in for one: `cp` saves over the file it was
//! given, `true` leaves without saving, `false` refuses the way `vi`'s `:cq` does. What is being
//! tested is the whole path a user takes, spawning included, which the unit tests cannot reach.
