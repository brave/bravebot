//! An incognito session adds nothing to `~/.bravebot`.
//!
//! These run against a real directory, redirected by `HOME`, because the claim is about the
//! filesystem afterwards rather than about which branch some function took. Every test here asks
//! the same question in a different place: after doing the thing that ordinarily writes, is there
//! anything on disk that was not there before? The one exception is the standing answer about
//! auto-vetting, which this mode refuses to read as well as to write, so the test for it asserts a
//! read that came back empty against a file that was there to be read.
//!
//! # Why a binary of its own
//!
//! Engaging is a one-way door for the life of a process, which is the property that makes it
//! trustworthy and also the reason these cannot share a binary with [`persist`]. An integration
//! test is its own process, so this file engages once at the top of each test and no other test
//! in the workspace is affected.
//!
//! # Why each test also reads
//!
//! A test asserting that nothing was written passes just as well when nothing was attempted: a
//! mistyped `HOME`, a helper that silently did nothing. So each test below first reads back
//! something it seeded, which fails unless the directory really is the one the code under test is
//! looking at. The read is the proof that the absence of a write means something.
//!
//! [`persist`]: ../persist.rs
