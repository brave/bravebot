//! Where global state lives on disk.
//!
//! `~/.bravebot` holds anything that should outlive a session: prompt history, the model the user
//! chose, the theme they paint the interface in, and how they edit text. The directory rather than a
//! per-project file, for the same reason in each case: a question worth asking again is usually worth
//! asking in another checkout too, and which model to think with, which theme to draw in and which
//! keys move the caret are not properties of a checkout.
//!
//! Every operation here degrades to doing nothing. A missing home directory, a read-only disk, a
//! corrupt file: none of that is worth refusing to start over, because the session works without
//! any of it, falling back to the configured default.
//!
//! An incognito session is the same shape deliberately rather than by accident: [`writable`]
//! answers `None`, and every write below takes the branch it already had for a machine with no
//! home. Reads are untouched, so the session still opens with the model and theme the user chose.
//!
//! [`load_vetting`] is the one read resolved through [`writable`] as well, so a session that adds
//! nothing here inherits nothing from that file either. The model and the theme decide what a
//! session looks like; that one decides whether somebody is asked before content nobody vouched
//! for reaches the planner, and a private session is the wrong place to inherit an answer to it.
//!
//! # What comes back is not trusted
//!
//! A history file can be edited, and on a shared machine it can be edited by someone else. So a
//! recalled prompt is not fed to a turn: it is placed in the input box, where the user reads it
//! and presses Enter. That keystroke is what makes it trusted, exactly as typing it would have.
//!
//! The model file is a name, not an instruction, and it lands in a request's routing field. What
//! makes that safe is not the file: it is that the whole directory is the user's own configuration
//! surface, on the footing [`bravebot_core::policy::Policy::label_user_configuration`] describes, and
//! that a name the server does not recognise is reset to [`bravebot_config::DEFAULT_MODEL`] rather
//! than obeyed.
