//! Whether a newer bravebot has been published, and the command that takes it.
//!
//! No model, no turn, and no token: a version number, asked of the registry this copy was
//! installed from and compared against the one compiled in.
//!
//! # Startup waits for none of it
//!
//! The line shown at startup comes out of `~/.bravebot`, where an earlier launch wrote the answer
//! down. Asking again happens on a thread nothing joins, at most once a day, and what it learns is
//! for the next launch. Somebody opening a session on a train waits for nothing and, with no
//! answer on disk yet, is told nothing.
//!
//! # Only an installation there is a command for
//!
//! Two ways of installing bravebot have an update command this program can name: the npm package,
//! whose launcher says which it is, and the install script, which writes down where it put the
//! binary. Everything else, a build from source above all, is left alone. Telling somebody who
//! compiled this that a release exists, without a command that would install it, is noise.
//!
//! # What the fetched number decides
//!
//! Whether one line is printed, and nothing else. It reaches no request field, no turn and no
//! planner's context. The version in that line is composed from the three numbers parsed out of
//! the answer rather than from the answer's own bytes, so nothing a registry says is quoted back
//! onto somebody's screen.
