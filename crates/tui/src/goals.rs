//! A condition the session works towards.
//!
//! `/goal` holds one sentence a person typed and puts it to a judge when a turn ends. Where the
//! judge says the condition does not hold yet, the work goes back for another turn; where it says
//! anything else, the goal is over. The condition is settled the moment it is typed and never
//! changes afterwards, so nothing a turn reads, writes or says can decide when this session is
//! allowed to stop.
//!
//! A goal starts no work of its own. It has a condition and no prompt, so an armed goal sits there
//! until the person sends something, and what it then keeps going is their own request.
//!
//! Nothing here is written to disk. A goal lives as long as the session that set it.
