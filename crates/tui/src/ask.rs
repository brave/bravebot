//! Putting the planner's question to the user, in the terminal.
//!
//! The same discipline as [`crate::confirm`], for the same reason: the turn is blocked waiting,
//! so an unreadable terminal, a lost event stream, or a key nobody defined must resolve to a
//! definite answer rather than to a hang. Here that answer is [`Answer::Declined`], which the
//! kernel turns into words the planner can act on.
//!
//! Reached through [`crate::confirm::TerminalConfirmer`], which is the terminal's whole side of
//! the human channel: it draws a diff for a write and this picker for a question.
//!
//! Declining is always one keypress away. A question the user does not want is a question they
//! can dismiss, and a picker with no exit would make the model able to stall the session.
