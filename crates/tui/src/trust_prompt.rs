//! Asking, at startup, whether to trust the working directory.
//!
//! The answer decides how the session behaves. Trusting the directory means work inside it
//! proceeds without a prompt for every write, because reads from it return trusted data.
//! Declining means everything is untrusted, so every write is shown, which is the correct
//! behaviour for a directory whose contents came from somewhere else.
//!
//! Nothing is trusted by default. An unreadable terminal, an unexpected key, or a lost event
//! stream all resolve to declining, because the failure mode of guessing wrong here is that a
//! session silently writes to files nobody vouched for.
//!
//! The one session that is not asked is the one bypassing every permission, which answers this
//! question along with the rest. [`answered_by`] is where that is decided.
//!
//! A settings file may name directories to open beside the working directory, and a name in one is
//! a request rather than a grant: each is put as its own question and only an accepted one is
//! opened. A file arriving with a checkout is the easiest thing on the machine to write to, so a
//! name in one deciding what is reachable and trusted would be reach granted by whatever last
//! edited it.
