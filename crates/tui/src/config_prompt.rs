//! Choosing how the input box edits text.
//!
//! Shown by `/config`. One question so far, which is whether the box edits the way vi does, and the
//! choice is written to `~/.bravebot`: it outlives the session that made it and applies in every
//! directory, the same as the model, the theme and the effort level.
//!
//! Drawn as a centred panel over the session, so the transcript stays visible. Enter takes the row
//! under the cursor. Escape leaves the style that was in force alone.
//!
//! Nothing labelled is involved. The words are drawn for a person, who picks one, and what their pick
//! changes is which keys move a caret in a box they are typing into.
//!
//! # Why the panel exists for one question
//!
//! Because the alternative is a command per preference, and this is the second of them: `/theme` and
//! `/effort` each took a word of the command space for one choice. A panel is where the third and the
//! fourth go without another verb being invented, and it is the surface somebody coming from Claude
//! Code already looks for.
