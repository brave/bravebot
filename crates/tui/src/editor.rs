//!
//! A prompt worth thinking about outgrows the box it is typed in. The caret reaches any word of it
//! now, but the box is still ten rows at most and has nothing to search, fold or reflow with.
//! Ctrl-G hands the line to whatever the user edits text with, waits for them to finish, and takes
//! back what they saved.
//!
//! Nothing labelled passes through here. The line is the user's own words on their way from the
//! keyboard to their editor and back, and nothing read out of the workspace joins them.
//!
//! `$VISUAL` and `$EDITOR` hold a command line by convention, and one is split into argv here
//! rather than handed to a shell. That is the rule the rest of the system runs under, and it
//! costs nothing to keep: a shell between the user's configuration and what starts would be a
//! second interpreter with its own opinions about quoting.
