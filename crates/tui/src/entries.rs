//! Workspace entries offered while a file reference is being typed.
//!
//! # What an `@` reference means
//!
//! Naming a file with `@` puts its **contents into the turn as trusted input**, exactly as
//! `--file` does on the command line, because the user named it and the user is the one party whose
//! word makes something trusted. That is the whole point: a file the planner may read and compare
//! and act on, rather than a reference it can only carry.
//!
//! So this list exists to make that choice an informed one. It is drawn from the directory itself
//! rather than from anything a model said, it is shown to the person typing, and the file it names
//! becomes context only once they press Enter on the line. The keystroke is the grant, the same way
//! it is for a prompt recalled out of history.
//!
//! Nothing here is a decision derived from untrusted content. Filenames are content, and this
//! walks the directory to show them to a person, which is the release
//! [`bravebot_core::policy::Policy::names_for_display`] already makes for the same reason: the user owns
//! the workspace, and an interface that will not tell them which files are in it has protected
//! them from nothing. No name reaches a model from here.
