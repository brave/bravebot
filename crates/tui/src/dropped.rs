//! Recognising a file dropped on the window.
//!
//! A terminal has no notion of a drop. What arrives is a bracketed paste of whatever the window
//! manager handed over, which is the path, so recognising one means looking at a paste and
//! deciding whether it is a path or prose. That decision is made here and nowhere else.
//!
//! Getting it wrong in one direction costs a paste: a paragraph that mentions a filename would
//! turn into an attachment and the words would vanish. So the test is deliberately strict, and a
//! paste is a drop only when **every** token in it names a file that exists. Prose containing a
//! real path stays prose, because prose has other words in it.
//!
//! Nothing here decides anything from the contents of a file. It reads names, which the user is
//! about to see on their own screen, and asks the filesystem whether they exist. What kind of file
//! each name is comes from `bravebot_filetype::by_name`, which the desktop window asks as well.
