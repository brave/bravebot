//! Selecting text off the screen with the mouse.
//!
//! Capturing the mouse is what makes the wheel scroll the transcript, and it costs the terminal
//! its own selection: a drag arrives here instead of highlighting anything, so a user who tries
//! to copy a line gets nothing at all. Since the drag arrives here, it is answered here.
//!
//! The selection is over screen cells rather than over the text behind them. That is not a
//! shortcut: what the user swept over is what they saw, wrapped and scrolled exactly as it was
//! drawn, and the cells hold precisely that. Reading it back out of the buffer needs no second
//! copy of the layout to be kept in step with the first.
//!
//! Nothing labelled is involved. Everything on the screen was released for display before it was
//! drawn, and this reads the screen.
