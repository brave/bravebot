//! Searching the prompts already sent.
//!
//! Opened with Ctrl-R, the chord every shell answers with the same question. Up walks the history
//! one prompt at a time, which is the right way in when the thing wanted is the last one and no
//! way in at all when it is the hundredth: what a person remembers of an old prompt is a word out
//! of the middle of it, not how far back it was.
//!
//! Drawn over the transcript in place of the box, newest at the bottom, so the row a search starts
//! on is the one nearest where the eye already is and the list grows upwards into space the
//! transcript can spare.
//!
//! Nothing here sends anything. Enter puts the prompt in the box, where the person reads it and
//! presses Enter themselves, which is what makes it theirs: a history file can be edited, on a
//! shared machine by somebody else, so a stored line is content until a keystroke adopts it.
