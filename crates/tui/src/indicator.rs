//! The working indicator: a spinning glyph, a word, elapsed time, and tokens spent.
//!
//! ```text
//! ✻ Grooving… (12m 31s · ↓ 38.3k tokens)
//! ```
//!
//! Turns run synchronously, so the interface is unresponsive while one is in flight. Without
//! something visibly moving that is indistinguishable from a hang, and the two counters answer
//! the questions a waiting user actually has: how long has this been going, and what is it
//! costing me.
//!
//! `NO_MOTION` in the environment stills the glyph. The counters go on counting, because a figure
//! that changes when the thing it measures does is information rather than animation.
//!
//! No progress bar, because there is nothing honest to measure against. A turn takes as many
//! rounds as the model asks for, and a bar that guessed would be a lie that looks like data.
//!
//! Rendering is separated from drawing so the whole thing is testable without a terminal.
