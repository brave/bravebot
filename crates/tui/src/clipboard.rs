//! Moving text and pictures between the terminal and the user's clipboard.
//!
//! Copying goes out two ways, tried in order, because neither works everywhere. The platform's own
//! tool is what works locally and is always there on macOS and Windows; the escape sequence is what
//! works over ssh, where the clipboard that matters belongs to the terminal at the other end and no
//! local tool can reach it.
//!
//! Pasting comes back in one way, and only because the terminal cannot do it. Command-V on macOS
//! never reaches this process at all: the byte stream over a pty has no encoding for that modifier,
//! and the terminal claims the chord for itself in any case. What the terminal does instead is
//! write the clipboard's *text* into the pty, and an image has no text, so the picture a user is
//! looking at is the one thing the ordinary paste cannot carry. Reading the clipboard here goes
//! around the pty entirely, which is why Control-V can move what Command-V cannot.
//!
//! Nothing labelled passes through here. What is copied was read off the screen, and everything on
//! the screen was released for display before it was drawn. What is pasted is the user's own input,
//! on the footing of the prompt it lands in, which
//! [`bravebot_core::policy::Policy::admit_pasted_image`] states in full.
