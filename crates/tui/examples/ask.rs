//! Drive the question picker by hand, with no model, no network and no credentials.
//!
//! ```sh
//! cargo run -p bravebot-tui --example ask
//! ```
//!
//! The series below stands in for one the planner would have sent: a question with details on
//! its options, one taking several answers, and one with no options at all. What the picker
//! returns is printed through the same kernel function the tool uses, so what appears on stdout
//! afterwards is exactly the text the planner would have been given.
//!
//! Worth pressing: enter and escape on each question, space on the multiple-answer one, the
//! arrow keys down onto the free-text row, and ctrl-c to confirm it does not answer anything.
