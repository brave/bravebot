//! Where a turn's wall clock went.
//!
//! A turn takes a length of time, and until now that was the only thing recorded about it. The
//! figure is unactionable on its own: a turn that took four minutes because the model was slow, one
//! that took four minutes because a test suite ran, and one that took four minutes because it put a
//! diff on the screen and waited for somebody to come back from lunch are the same number and want
//! three different fixes.
//!
//! So the clock is split four ways, and the split is a partition rather than a set of overlapping
//! measures: every millisecond of a turn is charged to exactly one of inference, tools, stalled, or
//! the remainder. That is what makes the remainder worth reading. Approval prompts happen inside
//! tool calls, so what is spent waiting for a person is taken out of the tool figure rather than
//! counted in both.
//!
//! Milliseconds, and `u64` rather than `Duration`, because these are written into a session record
//! and read back by whatever is to hand. A `Duration` serialises as a struct of seconds and
//! nanoseconds, which is a poor thing to meet in a JSON file six months later.
