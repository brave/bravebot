//! Standing instructions, and the skills on offer, as text for the system prompt.
//!
//! Two kinds of thing reach the planner before it is asked anything, and they are not alike.
//!
//! **Instructions**, which are `AGENTS.md` and the name and description of every skill it may
//! load. These are exactly the kind of input this repository is careful about, and they go through
//! the gate below.
//!
//! **Facts about where it is working**, which are the working directory, the platform, the date,
//! and the directory this session has to itself. These are not instructions and there is no file
//! behind them: see [`environment`] for why they do not go through the gate, and why nothing read
//! out of the workspace may join them.
//!
//! # One way in, and it refuses
//!
//! Every source passes `Policy::read_trusted_content`, which hands the bytes over when they are
//! trusted and refuses otherwise. A refusal means the file is left out and the user is told; it
//! is never quarantined into a reference, because a reference to standing instructions is no use
//! to anybody.
//!
//! Going through that gate rather than `Policy::present` is sound only because it refuses
//! everything `present` would have quarantined. For trusted content the two agree: `present`
//! returns it visible, and its absorb is a no-op at trusted integrity, so nothing about the
//! context is left unrecorded by taking this path.
//!
//! # Why the system prompt, and not a message
//!
//! The system prompt belongs to the build rather than to the conversation, so it is not stored
//! and is put in front of each request afresh. A persistent session therefore holds one copy of
//! AGENTS.md however many turns it runs, where a `Message::user` would accumulate one per turn.
