//! Exact text replacement, and the reasons to refuse one.
//!
//! An edit names a passage to replace rather than a whole file, which is what makes its
//! approval reviewable. But naming a passage can be ambiguous, and an ambiguous edit
//! mutates bytes nobody chose. So the two ambiguous cases are refused outright:
//!
//! - the passage is not in the file, so the model is working from a stale or imagined read;
//! - the passage occurs more than once, so which one was meant is unknowable.
//!
//! Refusing is safe in a way that guessing is not: a refusal costs a step and tells the
//! model what to fix, while a wrong guess destroys work the user did not review.
//!
//! Matching is exact and byte-for-byte. Fuzzy correction, meaning trimming whitespace or
//! re-indenting to fit, is deliberately absent: it turns "this is what I am replacing" into a guess, and
//! the guess is the part that would not be shown to the reviewer.
//!
//! The one adjustment is to line terminators, and only where the file has a single kind. A file
//! whose every terminator is `\r\n` has no place an LF passage could match, so `\n` in the passage
//! and in its replacement is read as that file's `\r\n`. That is a rule about the file rather than a
//! guess about the passage, it never changes a terminator the file already has, and the approval
//! says the ending was kept ([`crate::diff::Diff::line_endings`]).
