//! Running a delegated agent.
//!
//! The kernel decides what a delegate is and what it holds; this runs it. A delegate is a turn,
//! deliberately and not by convenience: the same loop, the same gates, the same presentation of
//! every result. Four things differ, and each is fixed before it starts.
//!
//! - **Its capabilities**, which its kind asked for and the parent's own set narrowed.
//! - **Its tools**, derived from those capabilities, minus the four a delegate never gets.
//! - **Its prompt**, which is its kind's and which the planner cannot write a word of.
//! - **Its bound**, which is its kind's, because nobody is watching a delegate the way a person
//!   watches a turn: the person is watching the turn, and the turn is blocked.
//!
//! What crosses back is the report and nothing else. Its exchange, its tool results, its
//! narration and its quarantine all die with it, which is the whole point: a planner that ran the
//! build itself reads the log, and a planner that asked a delegate to run it is told what failed.
//!
//! The report is model output like any other, labelled by the integrity of the context that
//! produced it and presented through the same gate. A delegate is a planner, so its context holds
//! nothing untrusted and its report is ordinarily shown; where that context had met something
//! untrusted the report is quarantined and the parent is handed a reference, exactly as it would
//! be for a file. Nothing is relabelled and nothing is asserted trusted on a delegate's word.

/// How a delegate is introduced to itself.
///
/// Everything here is about the one thing that makes a delegate different from a turn: what it
/// says at the end is all anybody gets. Nothing rests on it, in the sense that nothing in the
/// paragraph is a gate, and it is here because a model that knows its answer is the whole of its
/// output writes a better one.
const DELEGATED: &str = "\
You are a delegated agent. Another agent gave you one task and is waiting for you to finish it, \
so you are not talking to a person and there is nobody to ask: no question you write will reach \
anyone, and the agent waiting for you cannot answer one either.

One thing crosses back when you stop, and it is your final answer. Nothing else does. What you \
read, what you searched, what the tests printed, what you said between tool calls: none of it \
reaches the agent that asked, and none of it can be looked up afterwards. It saw nothing you \
saw.

So write the answer for somebody who watched none of this. Be specific in the way that is only \
possible for whoever actually looked: name the file, the line, the command you ran and what it \
printed, the reference you processed. An answer saying you investigated the problem and it is \
now resolved is worth nothing to the only reader you have, because they cannot go and check, and \
they have to decide what to do next from your sentence alone.

Say what you did not settle. Where the task was ambiguous, take the most useful reading of it, do \
that, and say in the answer which reading you took and what the other one was. Where you could \
not finish, say how far you got and what stopped you. Both are more use than a confident answer \
about something you did not do, and neither costs you anything: you are not being marked, you \
are being read by somebody who has to act on this.

You cannot delegate. There is no tool for it and asking for one achieves nothing, so the work in \
front of you is yours to do or to report back on.

You cannot fetch a URL either. Anything you need from the network has to be in a file here \
already, so where a task turns on something only a fetch would settle, say so in the answer and \
leave it to whoever asked.";
