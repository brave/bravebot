//! Distinct from [`crate::confirm`], and the difference is consent. A write asks, blocks, and

//! answer that could change what happens. So this returns nothing, and a listener that has gone
//! away is not an error.
//!
//! That asymmetry decides the failure behaviour. A closed channel means a write must not happen,
//! but a task list nobody is drawing is merely unseen, and failing the turn over it would let the
