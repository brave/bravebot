//! Working out which binary a program name means.
//!
//! `bravebot_core::programs::TrustedPrograms` is keyed by resolved path rather than by the name a
//! planner typed, and the reason is the one `bravebot_core::pure` states: a name is not a program.
//! `$PATH` decides what `grep` means, and on the machine this was developed against it means
//! `ugrep`, a different implementation with a far larger option surface. An approval recorded
//! against the string would follow the name onto whatever it later pointed at.
//!
//! So resolution happens once, before the person is asked. What they are shown is the resolved
//! path, what the list records is the resolved path, and what is executed is the resolved path.
//! Those being the same value is the point: resolving again after the approval would leave a
//! window in which `$PATH` changed and something else ran.
//!
//! This crate does the looking up because `bravebot-core` performs no I/O.
