//! Line diffs, so a person reviewing a write sees the change rather than the result.
//!
//! A write approval is only meaningful if the reviewer can tell what would be lost. A
//! whole proposed body does not show that: the reader has to hold the old file in their
//! head and spot the difference. So the confirmation shows a diff, and the parts that did
//! not change are collapsed to keep the question on screen.
//!
//! Both sides arrive here as plain strings, and this module reasons about no labels, because it
//! is reached from inside the gate rather than after it. A diff counts and compares content, so
//! computing one from bytes already released for a screen would be the read
//! [LABEL-6](../../../docs/specs/labels.md#LABEL-6) refuses. `Policy::render_pair_in_place` is
//! what hands the two sides over, and what comes back out is labelled by the taint of both.
