//! The `lsp` tool: a question for a language server, and the two footings its answer comes back on.
//!
//! Every argument is routing, so this module's job on the way in is the ordinary one: promote what
//! the planner proposed, refuse what a deny rule covers, and pass integers through.
//!
//! On the way out it does the one thing no other tool does. An answer holds locations and it may
//! hold text, and those are not on the same footing:
//!
//! - A **location** is structure. It was read off the server's index, it has nowhere for prose to
//!   sit, and it reaches the planner whatever the trust map says about the file it names. This is
//!   [LSP-3], argued the way [RUN-13] argues for an exit status.
//! - The **text** at a location is content. Hover text is bytes a file chose, and no answer says
//!   which file chose them, so it is untrusted and the kernel quarantines it.
//!
//! So one result may be a visible list of locations whose hover text is a reference. That is not an
//! inconsistency; it is the split doing its job.
//!
