//! Running a command line the user typed themselves.
//!
//! This is the one place in the repository that hands a string to a shell, and it exists for
//! exactly one caller: shell mode, where the person at the keyboard typed the line and pressed
//! Enter. Nothing the planner produces may reach here.
//!
//! # Why a shell is admissible here and nowhere else
//!
//! [`crate::exec`] takes an argument vector and never builds a command line, because the argv it
//! runs was chosen by the planner and a planner can be steered into choosing it. The exclusion of
//! shell strings is about that: a shell string fuses the destination with the payload, so there is
//! no separable routing field for a person to endorse, and endorsement is what makes planner-chosen
//! argv safe to run.
//!
//! A line the user typed has no such problem, because there is nothing left to endorse. The person
//! who would have been asked to approve the routing is the person who wrote it. Globs, `$VAR`,
//! redirection and `&&` are the reason someone opens a shell at all, and refusing them would make
//! shell mode a worse terminal than the one the user already has in the next window.
//!
//! So the exclusion still holds where it was always aimed: the planner has no shell, and
//! [`crate::exec`] must stay argv-only. Do not add a caller here that passes along anything a model
//! wrote, anything read from a file, or anything a processor produced. The provenance of the string
//! is the whole justification, and it cannot be checked from the bytes.
//!
//! # Not confined, like every other program
//!
//! Commands run with the access the user's own shell would give them, for the reason
//! [`crate::exec`] documents: `git push` needs `~/.ssh`, and the set of programs someone might ask
//! for cannot be enumerated. Shell mode changes nothing about that, since a user who wants to run
//! `rm -rf` in their own workspace is entitled to.
