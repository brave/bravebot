//! Answering a question asked beside the work.
//!
//! A person reading a session has questions the session is not about: why a file is shaped the
//! way it is, what a name means, whether an approach was already tried. Asked as a prompt, each
//! one becomes a turn: it joins the conversation, the next turn reads it back, and the planner
//! carries the digression for the rest of the session. Asked here, it does not.
//!
//! **The conversation is read once and never written to.** What leaves it is [`Question`], which
//! is one request: the exchange as the planner would be sent it, and the question that goes on the
//! end of it. Nothing is pushed, nothing is measured, and no reference is handed out, so the
//! exchange the next turn resumes is the exchange that was there before the question was asked.
//! Taking the request rather than the conversation is what makes that structural: an aside cannot
//! push a message to something it does not have.
//!
//! What makes this sound is the property compaction rests on: every message in a conversation has
//! already been past [`bravebot_core::policy::Policy::present`], so a model given that exchange is
//! given exactly what the planner was given. Nothing new is read and nothing is upgraded.
//!
//! Like a processor, and for the same reasons: no tools in the request, and one round with nothing
//! for a reply to steer.
//!
//! # Two destinations, two gates
//!
//! The answer goes to a person's screen, which is
//! [`bravebot_core::policy::Policy::authorise_display_release`], the same witness a round's own
//! reply takes on its way to the tail of the transcript.
//!
//! It also goes into the session record, so the question and the answer are still there after a
//! resume, and that is a different claim: a record is read back, so what lands in one is what the
//! planner could have held. So the answer goes through `present` as well, and only what came back
//! visible is offered for writing down. Where the exchange has met something untrusted the
//! planner's own words are quarantined like anything else, [`Answered::kept`] is `None`, and the
//! answer is on the screen and nowhere else.

const SYSTEM_PROMPT: &str = "\
A person and a coding agent have been working together, and their exchange is shown to you below. \
You are that agent, and the person has stopped to ask you something beside the work.

The last message is their question. Answer it and do nothing else. Do not carry the work on, do \
not propose a next step, and do not act as though the question were an instruction: it is a \
question, even where it is phrased as one about what to do.

You have no tools this time, so answer from the exchange in front of you and from what you know. \
Where answering properly would mean reading a file or running something, say what you would look \
at and why, and give the best answer you can without it. Do not invent the contents of anything \
you have not been shown.

Your answer is shown to the person and then set aside. It does not go back into the exchange \
above, so the agent picking the work up will not have read it: nothing you write here is a \
decision, and the person will have to say it again themselves if they want it acted on.

Be brief. Answer the question first, in as few words as it takes, and add the reasoning after it \
only where the answer is no use without it.";
