//! Plan then execute.
//!
//! The other mode in this crate is a loop: the model sees a result, decides what to do next,
//! sees that result, and so on. This one decides everything first. One model call turns the
//! task string into a step list, the kernel freezes it, and a driver walks it with no model in
//! the control path at all. Nothing a step reads can add a step, remove one, or change which
//! slot feeds which, because by the time the first byte is read the program is already fixed.
//!
//! This follows the plan-then-execute architecture in the SafeHouse specification, whose three
//! planning phases survive here as they are written there.
//!
//! # The phases
//!
//! 1. **Abstract planning**, in two calls, neither of which has tools.
//!    1. **Shape.** What has to happen, in plain words, as if a person were doing it. No JSON,
//!       no slots, no capability names. This is where the goal gets stated.
//!    2. **Fit.** The same work, expressed for a machine that cannot look at anything before
//!       deciding. This is the hard half, and separating it is what makes it hard *visibly*:
//!       a plan that assumed it would see a result has to become a transform here, or be
//!       declared impossible.
//!
//!    Two calls rather than one, and the reason it is still sound is not the count. It is that
//!    the planner's context holds the task string and the driver's own words and has never been
//!    shown anything else, which is as true of the second call as of the first. That is not a
//!    property of this mode: the planner is never shown untrusted content in either mode, since
//!    `Policy::present` quarantines it and hands over a reference.
//!    `Policy::before_planning` is where that is written down so a change has to get past it.
//!
//!    No step has read anything at this point either, which is a separate fact and worth
//!    keeping separate: the planning policy holds no read capability at all, so it is not that
//!    nothing happened to read, it is that nothing could have.
//!
//!    What is still refused is a *re-plan*: a plan that fails validation fails the run, and
//!    nothing replans once a step has read something.
//!
//!    Splitting also separates two failure modes that used to look identical from outside. A
//!    run that goes wrong now says whether the model misunderstood the goal, which the shape
//!    shows, or fitted it badly to the tool set, which the manifest shows, or was refused by a
//!    gate, which the audit trail shows. Both artefacts are kept and reported.
//!
//! 2. **Concrete mapping.** Deterministic, no model. Capability names become tool names through
//!    a table the model has never seen.
//! 3. **Structural validation.** Deterministic, no model, in the kernel.
//!    [`bravebot_core::policy::Policy::adopt_manifest`] refuses a plan from a context that met
//!    anything untrusted, then [`bravebot_core::manifest::validate`] refuses one that is not well
//!    formed. Any violation fails the run; a manifest is never half adopted.
//!
//! Phase 2 is thinner here than in the specification, and the reason is worth stating rather
//! than papering over. There the mapping injects provider URLs, MCP tool names, and API bases
//! from an operator registry, so that a malicious domain cannot reach the planner. A coding
//! agent working in one directory has no providers to inject: the whole of its world is the
//! workspace the user opened. What remains is the part that still buys something, which is that
//! the planner names capabilities and never tool names.
//!
//! The specification's `CAPABILITY_LABEL` has no counterpart here either, and its absence is an
//! improvement rather than a gap. A static table mapping capability to label cannot express a
//! trust map keyed by path, so the label a read produces stays what it already was: the kernel's
//! decision at the moment of observation, from the path and the user's own trust rules.
//!
//! # What this mode cannot do
//!
//! `edit_file` is unavailable, because locating a passage to replace means having read the file
//! and the planner has read nothing. `todo_write` is unavailable because the manifest is a
//! better task list than a narrated one, having been fixed in advance. And there is no
//! conversation to resume: the planner is never shown a result, so there is nothing for a second
//! turn to continue. A manifest run is one run, start to finish.

/// words first is not politeness to the model: it is the artefact a person reads when a run
/// does the wrong thing, and it is the difference between "it misunderstood me" and "it
/// understood me and could not express it".
///
/// It must nonetheless say that **an agent will carry this out and can read the workspace**. An
/// earlier version left that out, on the grounds that the first call should not think about
/// mechanism at all, and the model drew the only other conclusion available: that it was being
/// asked the question itself, could not see the files, and should ask the user to paste them.
/// The fit call then correctly refused to express "wait for the user" as a static manifest, and
/// a run failed at phase one for want of a sentence. Never remove it again.
const SHAPE_PROMPT: &str = "\
You are planning work in a code workspace. Say what has to happen to finish the task, as a short
numbered list, in plain words. Describe the goal and the steps someone would take.

An agent will carry out what you describe. It can read files in the workspace, search them, and
write them. So plan the reading: say which files should be read and what should be worked out
from them. You are not being asked to do the work and you are not expected to have seen any code.

Never ask for anything to be pasted or provided. Nothing will answer you: this is the only thing
you will be asked, and a plan that waits for a reply cannot be carried out. If you need to see a
file, that is a step, not a question.

Do not write JSON and do not name tools. How each step is carried out is somebody else's problem.

Be specific about which files are involved where the task names them, and say plainly where it \
does not name them and something will have to be searched for. If the task cannot be finished by \
reading and writing files in this workspace, say so and say why.

Keep it under ten lines.";

/// What the second planning call is told, on top of the capability catalogue.
///
/// Its whole job is the translation the first call was allowed to ignore: turning "look at this
/// and then decide" into something a machine with no ability to decide can run.
///
/// It says outright that a transform may decide whether to change anything, because otherwise
/// the translation has no answer for the commonest plan there is: change the file that does X,
/// where nothing here knows which file that is. A planner that may not look and may not branch
/// can still read every candidate and let a transform judge each one, and that reads as an
/// invention rather than an obvious move unless it is written down. It costs the guarantee
/// nothing. Each write still names its own path, fixed in the manifest before the run, and the
/// only thing the transform's judgement moves is which bytes land in a slot nobody reads.
const FIT_PROMPT: &str = "\
You are given a plan written as if the work could be done by someone who looks at things and \
then decides. Rewrite it as a static manifest for a machine that cannot do that.

There is no second turn. You will never be shown what a step produced, you cannot branch on it, \
and nothing can be added or changed once you have answered. Every step is fixed now.

The translation that matters: anywhere the plan says to look at something and then decide, the \
deciding has to happen inside a TRANSFORM, which is an isolated model that does see the text. \
Read into a slot, transform the slot, and act on what the transform produced. If some part of \
the plan cannot be expressed that way, say so rather than approximating it.

A TRANSFORM may be told to decide whether to change anything at all: rewrite the document if it \
is the one the task is about, and return it exactly as it was if it is not. That is how a fixed \
plan copes with not knowing which file is the right one. Read each candidate into its own slot, \
transform each with the same instruction, and write each one back to the path it was read from. \
No step has to be looked at first and nothing branches. Tell the transform the file's name and \
what the change is for, since it knows nothing else.";

/// The shape of the answer the second call must give.
///
/// It names capabilities, never tools. Kept apart from [`FIT_PROMPT`] because one says what the
/// job is and the other says what the output must look like, and the second is the part that
/// has to agree with the schema in the kernel.
const MANIFEST_PROMPT: &str = "\
Output ONLY valid JSON, with no prose, no explanation and no code fences. The shape is:

  {\"steps\": [{\"capability\": \"NAME\", \"args\": {...}}, ...]}

If the task cannot be done as a fixed list of these steps, output ONLY:

  {\"error\": \"<brief reason>\"}

Slots carry data between steps. A step that reads something names an out_slot to put it in, and \
a later step names that slot to use it. You choose the slot names; use short lowercase words. \
Every slot must be written by an earlier step before anything reads it, and no slot is written \
twice.

Rules that the manifest is checked against, so a plan breaking one is refused outright:

- Every read and every transform comes before the first write or answer. Nothing reads the \
  workspace after the plan has changed it.
- Paths are workspace-relative. No leading slash, no '..' anywhere in them.
- A path, directory, pattern or include is one string, never a list and never a number.
- A write takes either contents or from_slot, never both and never neither.
- At most one ANSWER step, and it says which slot holds the answer.

You cannot read a file yourself, so you cannot know what one contains. To say something about a \
file's contents, read it into a slot and TRANSFORM that slot: the transform is an isolated model \
that does see the text. To answer the user, ANSWER a slot a transform produced. Only use \
FILE_WRITE with contents for a file whose whole body you can write from the task alone.

A transform's answer belongs to the document it was given, and FILE_WRITE from_slot writes it \
back to that file and to no other. So to rewrite a file, read the whole of that one file into a \
slot and transform that slot alone. A transform over several slots, or over anything but a whole \
file, answers for no document: ANSWER can show what it produced, and no write can take it.";
