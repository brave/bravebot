//! Reading the `permissions` block out of the settings file.
//!
//! The kernel owns the rule language and this owns finding the file, because reading a rule needs
//! to know where `~` and the settings file are, which is I/O the kernel does not do. What crosses
//! the boundary is rule text and two directory names.
//!
//! # Why the anchors are what they are
//!
//! A `~/` rule points at the user's home directory. A `/` rule points at the directory the
//! settings file sits in, which is `~/.bravebot`: Claude Code anchors a single leading slash at
//! the settings source rather than at the filesystem root, so a rule written in a user-level file
//! means something inside that file's own directory. That is a trap worth reproducing rather than
//! improving on, because somebody who has read those docs will write `//` when they mean the root,
//! and quietly meaning something else here would be worse than agreeing.
