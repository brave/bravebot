//! What a session remembers between turns.
//!
//! A turn used to begin with nothing but the prompt it was given, so a session was a row of
//! strangers: the model could not be asked to try again, or to carry on, because it had never
//! heard of what came before. This is the record that fixes that.
//!
//! It changes nothing about the rule the repository rests on. Every string in here has already
//! been past [`bravebot_core::policy::Policy::present`]: either the kernel judged it trusted and
//! showed it to the planner, or what went in is a reference and the content stayed in
//! quarantine. Carrying the record forward therefore carries no untrusted bytes forward, because
//! there were never any in it.
//!
//! Three things travel with the messages:
//!
//! - the **quarantine**, so a reference the planner was given in an earlier turn still names
//!   something. A slot store that died with its turn would leave the conversation full of names
//!   for content that no longer exists.
//! - the **reference counter**, so two turns cannot both hand out `ref:0` and leave the planner
//!   with one name for two things.
//! - the **integrity** the conversation has met, so a later turn cannot label output better than
//!   an earlier turn would have. See [`bravebot_core::policy::Policy::resuming`].
