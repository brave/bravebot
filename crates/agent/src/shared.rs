//! Lending one confirmer, one reporter and one audit trail to several runs at once.
//!
//! A turn and the delegates it spawned run at the same time and each of the three is single: one
//! person answers the questions, one screen shows the lines, one trail records the decisions.
//! What they need is not a copy each but a turn each, which is what this is.
//!
//! # Why a lock and not a copy
//!
//! Copying is wrong for all three. Two trails leave a hole in the record exactly over the part of
//! the turn nobody watched. Two reporters interleave half-written lines. Two confirmers put two
//! questions on one screen, and a person cannot answer either without reading both.
//!
//! Holding the lock for the whole of one question is deliberate rather than a cost. A person is
//! asked one thing at a time, and a delegate that wants an answer while somebody is reading
//! another delegate's diff waits for them to finish reading it.
//!
//! # What this does not do
//!
//! It carries no content and reads none. Every method here takes what it was handed, takes the
//! lock, and passes it through. Usage totals stay with the delegate until collection; labelled
//! content keeps the label it arrived with.
