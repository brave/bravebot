//! Skills: instructions the user keeps for a kind of task.
//!
//! A skill is one `SKILL.md` in a directory of its own, opening with frontmatter that names it
//! and says when it applies:
//!
//! ```text
//! ---
//! name: commit-style
//! description: How commit messages are written here. Use before writing one.
//! ---
//!
//! the body
//! ```
//!
//! Only the name and the description reach the planner up front. The body is read when the
//! planner asks for it by name, which keeps a directory of long skills from filling a context
//! that has room for the task instead.
//!
//! # What this module may and may not read
//!
//! Everything here parses **trusted** text. A caller reaches this only after
//! `Policy::read_trusted_content` has handed the bytes over, which it does for a file in the
//! user's own directory and refuses for anything else. That refusal is the whole design: a
//! skill's name and description go into the system prompt verbatim, so a skill nobody vouched
//! for is dropped entirely rather than quarantined. A reference in place of a name would be no
//! use to anyone, and a name from a file an attacker wrote would be untrusted content in the
//! planner's context.

const LOOP: &str = "\
A loop repeats one prompt: the line the user typed when they started it. Every tick sends that \
same line again, unchanged, and nothing you do alters it. You are being asked the same question \
about a world that may have moved since the last time.

Each tick is a turn of its own in the same conversation, so what earlier ticks did is still \
there to read. Read it. A tick that repeats work the last one did has spent a request to learn \
nothing, and a tick that answers as though the question were new is the commonest way to waste \
one.

Do this tick's work, and only this tick's. A loop is not a way to ask for the whole job at once: \
if the line says to watch something, look at it as it is now and say what changed.

Keep the answer short. A tick that found nothing says so in a line rather than restating the \
situation, and somebody reading twenty of these should be able to see at a glance which one \
mattered.

There are two kinds of loop, and the turn you are in says which this is.

Where the user gave an interval, the timing is theirs. There is nothing for you to decide about \
it and no tool for it, so do not go looking for one and do not tell the user a tool is missing: \
the interval is already keeping time. Work the tick and answer.

Where they gave none, you are offered schedule_next, and the loop runs for exactly as long as \
you keep calling it. Call it once, at the end of the turn, after the work is done:

- delay_seconds from what you are actually waiting on rather than from a round number. Something \
  that takes ten minutes to change is not worth looking at in sixty seconds, and something that \
  changes hourly is not worth looking at in five minutes. The wait is held to between a second \
  and an hour, and it starts when this turn ends, so a whole turn separates two looks however \
  short you make it: asking for the floor buys you the pace of a turn, not the pace you named.
- noop true where this tick found nothing to do and changed nothing, false where something \
  happened worth keeping: an edit, a message, a finding. Runs of quiet ticks are counted and \
  shown to the user as a single line, so an honest noop is what keeps a long watch readable.
- reason in a few words, saying what you are waiting on. The user reads it.

Not calling it ends the loop, and that is the right answer once there is nothing left to watch. \
Say so in your answer rather than scheduling a tick to say it again.

Either kind stops when the user stops it. You never need to ask them to.
