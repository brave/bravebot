//! Shortening a conversation into a summary of itself.
//!
//! A session's request grows with every round, since each one re-sends the whole history, and
//! nothing ever gave any of it back. Compaction is what does: the older part of the exchange
//! stops being sent and a summary of it is sent instead. What the person sees is untouched, and
//! so is what the quarantine holds; see [`crate::conversation::Conversation::compacted`].
//!
//! **This is not a processor, and must not become one.** A processor is the one component allowed
//! to read untrusted content, and the price of that is that everything it produces is quarantined:
//! the planner gets a reference and never the bytes. A summary the planner may not read is not a
//! summary it can carry on from, so routing compaction through one would produce a feature that
//! cannot do the only thing it is for.
//!
//! What makes this call sound is the opposite property. Every message in a conversation has
//! already been past [`bravebot_core::policy::Policy::present`]: either the kernel judged it trusted
//! and showed it to the planner, or what went in was a reference and the bytes stayed in
//! quarantine. So a model given that exchange is given exactly what the planner was given, and
//! [`bravebot_core::policy::Policy::label_model_output`] labels what it writes the way it labels
//! anything else the planner said. Nothing is upgraded and nothing new is read.
//!
//! [`bravebot_core::policy::Policy::adopt_summary`] is the gate on the way back in, and it refuses once
//! the conversation's integrity has fallen. A refusal leaves the conversation exactly as it was.
//!
//! Like a processor, and for the same reasons: no tools in the request, and one round with nothing
//! for a reply to steer.

/// What the summariser is told to produce.
///
/// Addressed to the agent that will read it rather than to the person, because the person keeps
/// the transcript either way and it is the agent that has to pick the work up mid-sentence.
const SYSTEM_PROMPT: &str = "\
You are summarising part of a conversation between a person and a coding agent, so that the agent \
can carry on with less of it in front of it. What you write replaces that part of the exchange \
entirely: it is the only thing that will remain of it, so anything you leave out is gone.

The most recent exchanges are not shown to you. They are kept exactly as they are, so do not try \
to account for them and do not write a conclusion.

Be exact about who said what, and prefer a name to a pronoun. Call the person \"the user\" and \
the agent \"you\". Never write \"your\" for something of the user's: an agent reading \"your \
favourite colour is teal\" back takes it as its own favourite colour and says so. Write \"the \
user's favourite colour is teal\". The same goes the other way: what the agent did is what you \
did, not what the user did.

Keep, in whatever order reads best:

- what the user asked for, in their own words wherever the words matter, attributed to them
- what was decided, and what was decided against, and why
- every path read, written or created, spelled exactly as it appeared
- commands that were run, and what came of them
- what is finished, what is half done, and what has not been started
- every ref:N that was mentioned, and what each one was about
- anything the user corrected the agent about
- facts the user gave about themselves or their work, attributed to the user
- questions still outstanding

Name the path of every file the remaining work still has to touch, spelled exactly, next to the \
work itself. Outstanding work described without its paths cannot be picked up: the agent reading \
you cannot search for a file it has not been told exists, so it does the part it can see and \
reports the rest as done. A file that was located but not yet edited is the case this exists for, \
and the one most easily lost, because nothing in the exchange yet points at it.

Leave out the agent's account of how it got somewhere, and anything later work superseded.

Write plain prose, or prose with a short list in it. No preamble, no sign-off, and nothing about \
the fact that you are summarising: begin with the work itself.";
