//! Glob matching for workspace paths.
//!
//! Listings and searches need narrowing, say "just the Rust files under crates", or a model
//! spends a step reading a listing it mostly does not want.
//!
//! A glob rather than a regular expression, and hand-written rather than a dependency, for
//! the same reason `search` matches literally: patterns arrive through a turn, and a
//! backtracking engine turns a pattern into a denial-of-service vector. The matcher below
//! runs in time proportional to the path length times the pattern length, with no
//! backtracking and no recursion, so a hostile pattern costs nothing unusual.
//!
//! Supported, and nothing else:
//!
//! - `?` matches one character within a segment
//! - `*` matches any run of characters within a segment
//! - `**` matches across segment boundaries
//! - `{a,b}` matches either alternative, and may be nested
//!
//! A pattern with no `/` matches against the file name alone, so `*.rs` finds Rust files at
//! any depth, which is the reading a person intends when they type it.
//!
//! Brace groups are expanded before matching rather than matched, which is what keeps the
//! guarantee above: each alternative is an ordinary pattern walked once, so a group costs a
//! multiple of the work and never a power of it. [`expand`] is separate from [`matches`]
//! because a walk applies one pattern to thousands of paths, and expanding once at the top
//! is the difference between one allocation and one per file.

/// How many patterns one expansion may produce.
///
/// Groups multiply: `{a,b}{c,d}{e,f}` is eight patterns and ten such groups are a thousand.

/// finding nothing, rather than quietly becoming a walk nobody asked for.
