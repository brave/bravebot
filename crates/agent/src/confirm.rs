//! Asking the user to approve an effect, and putting the planner's questions to them.
//!
//! Four questions travel this way, and they differ in what is at stake. A write and a run ask for
//! permission, and the answer decides whether an effect happens. A question the planner posed asks
//! for information, and the answer decides nothing on its own: it is text the model reads. What
//! they share is consent, so all three live here rather than in [`crate::report`], which announces
//! and expects no reply.
//!
//! A model-proposed write path cannot be promoted the way a read path can: a read that
//! goes to the wrong file wastes a step, while a write to the wrong file destroys work.
//! So the trust for a write comes from a person.
//!
//! The approval is what mints the endorsement. That endorsement is single-use and bound to
//! the exact path shown, so an approval cannot be replayed against a second write or
//! redirected to a different file after the fact.
//!
//! What is shown is a diff, not a body. An approval the reviewer cannot actually read is
//! decorative, and a whole-file body asks them to spot the difference themselves.
