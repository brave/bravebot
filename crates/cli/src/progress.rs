//! Progress for a run with no interface to draw on.

//! A one-shot run has no spinner and no redraw, so without this it prints nothing at all until

//! files and edits three of them is a long silence to sit through.
//!
//! Everything here goes to stderr. The reply is the command's output and belongs on stdout,
//! where it can be piped into something else; a progress log that shared that stream would
//! corrupt it.
