//! Every word this program says to a person, and the machinery for saying it in their language.
//!
//! Catalogs live in `locales/`, one file per locale, in a subset of Project Fluent. The build
//! script compiles them into Rust, so what ships is `&'static str`s and the code that assembles
//! them, and a message is reached through [`t!`]:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! use bravebot_i18n::t;
//!
//! block.title(t!(confirm_write_title));
//! footer.push(t!(status_turns, count = session.turns));
//! ```
//!
//! ## What is not in here
//!
//! Only text a person reads. The words the planner reads are not translated and do not belong in
//! a catalog: a tool's description, the preamble, and the `refused: …` a tool answers with are all
//! part of the interface to the model, and rewording them in another language changes what the
//! model does. They are pinned by the specs for exactly that reason. The rule is the audience, not
//! the crate: a string in `bravebot-agent` that ends up on the screen is a message, and a string
//! in `bravebot-tui` that ends up in a request is not.
//!
//! ## Why a key can never be a value
//!
//! [`t!`] takes the message name as a bare word, and the macro has one arm per message in the
//! reference catalog. There is no arm that accepts a runtime string, so there is no way to write
//! a lookup whose result depends on a value, which means no path by which content the agent was
//! handed can choose what is said. A misspelled name does not fall back and does not render a key
//! on somebody's screen: it fails to compile, naming the line.
//!
//! Argument names are checked the same way, by being the fields of a generated struct. Passing an
//! argument the message does not take, or forgetting one it does, is a compilation error.
//!
//! ```
//! assert_eq!(bravebot_i18n::t!(count_turns, count = 2), "2 turns");
//! ```
//!
//! A name no catalog defines:
//!
//! ```compile_fail
//! bravebot_i18n::t!(no_message_is_called_this);
//! ```
//!
//! An argument the message does not take:
//!
//! ```compile_fail
//! bravebot_i18n::t!(count_turns, quantity = 2);
//! ```
//!
//! A key that is a value rather than a name, which is the shape this crate exists to make
//! unwritable:
//!
//! ```compile_fail
//! let chosen = untrusted_file_contents();
//! bravebot_i18n::t!(chosen);
//! ```
//!
//! ## Why nothing here can parse a catalog
//!
//! The parser is compiled for the build script and for tests and is not part of the library a
//! binary links, so a call to it is not a call anybody can write. The sibling module the
//! generated code does call is there:
//!
//! ```
//! assert_eq!(bravebot_i18n::plural::category("en", 1), "one");
//! ```
//!
//! The parser is not:
//!
//! ```compile_fail
//! bravebot_i18n::catalog::parse("hello = hi");
//! ```
