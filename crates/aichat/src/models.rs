//! Asked so a person can pick one, and for nothing else. No model reads any of this: the list
//! reaches a picker, the person there chooses, and what comes back is the name sent in the `model`
//! field of a later request. That field is routing, and the endorsement for it is the choice.
//!
//! The endpoint answers with a bare array rather than an OpenAI-style `{"data": [...]}` envelope.
//! [`automatic-bravebot`](bravebot_config::DEFAULT_MODEL) is added here when the listing omits it,
//! so a picker always offers the product's default triage entry.
