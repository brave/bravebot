//! OS-level confinement for untrusted subprocesses.
//!
//! One boundary, several backends. The confined process is whatever acts on model
//! output: a processor sub-agent, or a stdio MCP server we launch. Trusted code that
//! performs already-authorised effects is guarded by information-flow gates instead;
//! sandboxing it would confine our own code while leaving the untrusted part free.
//!
//! # Fail closed
//!
//! If confinement cannot be established, [`Sandbox::spawn`] refuses rather than
//! running the process unconfined. Silently degrading is worse than an error: the
//! caller believes it has a guarantee it does not have, and the audit trail records a
//! sandbox that was never applied.
