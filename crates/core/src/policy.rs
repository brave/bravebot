//! The reference monitor.
//!
//! Every consequential operation passes through a [`Policy`] gate. The policy tracks
//! provenance labels and refuses operations that would let untrusted data decide where
//! an effect lands.
//!
//! Two structural properties differ from a runtime-checked design:
//!
//! - **Routing is precommitted at construction.** [`Policy::begin`] takes the routing
//!   block, so an un-precommitted policy cannot exist. There is no window in which a
//!   gate could run before routing was fixed, and no precommit call to forget.
//! - **One policy per turn, enforced by moves.** [`Policy`] is neither `Clone` nor
//!   `Copy`, and [`Policy::finish`] consumes it. Reusing a finished policy does not
//!   compile, so a later turn cannot inherit an earlier turn's routing.
//!
//! The second property is what makes an iterative agent safe: each turn is a fresh
//! run with its own routing precommit, rather than one long-lived policy whose routing
//! drifts as untrusted content accumulates.
