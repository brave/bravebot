//! The frozen program a manifest run executes.
//!
//! A turn decides what to do next after each thing it reads. A manifest run decides everything
//! before it reads anything: the planner emits a step list, this module refuses it or freezes
//! it, and the driver then walks it with no model in the control path. Untrusted content can
//! still change the bytes a step carries. It cannot add a step, remove one, or change which
//! slot feeds which, because by the time any content exists the program is already fixed.
//!
//! This follows the plan-then-execute architecture in the SafeHouse specification, including
//! its tool schema: a static contract per tool, checked by a pure function, with any violation
//! failing the run rather than being repaired.
//!
//! # What validation is for
//!
//! Not defence against a hostile planner. [`validate`] is crate-private: the only
//! caller is [`crate::policy::Policy::adopt_manifest`], which has already established
//! that the draft came from a context holding nothing untrusted. Validation is what
//! makes the frozen program *well formed*: every slot read was written by an earlier
//! step, no slot is written twice, no path leaves the workspace, and nothing reads
//! anything after the first action. Those are the properties the driver relies on to
//! run without asking questions, and a manifest that fails one of them is refused whole.
//!
//! # Tiers
//!
//! The specification's three tiers survive intact, because they are what makes a plan
//! reviewable before it runs:
//!
//! - [`Tier::Fetch`] reads. No model is involved at all: the driver calls the same workspace
//!   code an ordinary turn calls, and the result goes straight into a slot.
//! - [`Tier::Process`] transforms. An isolated model with no tools reads the slots its step
//!   names and writes one more.
//! - [`Tier::Act`] changes something or shows something. These are the only steps with a
//!   consequence outside the slot store, and they are the ones a person endorses.
