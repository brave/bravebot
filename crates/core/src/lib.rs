//! Information-flow kernel.
//!
//! This crate performs no I/O. It defines the label lattice, quarantined storage,
//! capabilities, and the policy gates every consequential action passes through.
//! Nothing here prints: diagnostics leave through typed events so the audit trail
//! stays machine-readable.
//!
//! # Credit
//!
//! Ali Shahin Shamsabadi and Brian R. Bondy developed the idea this crate implements: the
//! `L = I × C` lattice, write-once quarantine, and the routing/content asymmetry that
//! makes injected text unable to redirect an action. Ali built the first prototype of it
//! in SafeHouse; this applies the same idea to a general-purpose agent.
