//! A rule and a prompt are both about who is being talked to, so both need the host and neither
//! needs the rest. A destination somebody wrote down in full is the other question, and its
//! answer is the socket rather than the name, port included. Parsing is deliberately the smallest
//! thing that answers either: no dependency, no percent-decoding, and no attempt to normalise
//! anything a comparison does not depend on.
//!
//! The one property that matters is that this cannot report a host the request will not go to. A
//! parser that read `https://example.com@evil.test/` as `example.com` would hand a person the
//! wrong name to approve, so userinfo is dropped rather than mistaken for a host: everything
//! before the last `@` in the authority belongs to whoever wrote the URL, not to the destination.
