//! The planner's task list.
//!
//! A turn of any length is opaque from outside: the user sees a spinner and has no idea whether
//! the model is on the first of five steps or the last. A list the model maintains as it works
//! answers that, and answers it in the model's own terms rather than the driver's guess.
//!
//! The list is model output, so it carries the integrity of the context the model was working
//! from. That makes it content, never routing: nothing here decides anything. It lands nowhere,
//! has no destination to endorse, and is read by exactly two things, the planner that wrote it
//! and the human watching. Both are gated already, by [`crate::policy::Policy::present`] and
//! [`crate::policy::Policy::render_in_place`] respectively.
//!
//! Rendering lives here rather than in the interface because shaping the list means looking at
//! the statuses in it, and the driver may not hold untrusted bytes to look at them. The kernel
//! can, inside a render closure, because choosing a glyph decides nothing an attacker could
//! steer: every status renders as *something*, and no item is dropped or reordered on the
//! strength of its text.
