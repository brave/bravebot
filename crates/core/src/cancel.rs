//! Asking a turn to stop.
//!
//! A turn can spend a long time waiting on a model, and a user who has changed their mind should
//! not have to wait it out. So a turn carries a token it checks between steps, and setting the
//! token asks it to stop at the next check.
//!
//! Cooperative rather than pre-emptive, and deliberately so. Killing a turn mid-effect could
//! leave a file half written, so cancellation happens only at points where nothing is in
//! progress: between rounds, before each tool call, and between the chunks of a streamed reply.
//!
//! A streamed reply is the exception that proves the rule rather than a hole in it. Reading a
//! response body applies nothing and writes nothing, so stopping part way leaves nothing part
//! done, and the reply was going to be discarded whatever happened. Read to the end regardless,
//! stopping a turn took exactly as long as not stopping it, which is the case a person reaches
//! for the key in. A request that is not streamed still runs to completion.
//!
//! The flag only ever goes from unset to set. Reusing a token for a second turn would risk
//! cancelling it before it began, so each turn gets a fresh one.
