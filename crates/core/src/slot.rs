//! Write-once quarantined storage.
//!
//! Untrusted content lands in a slot and stays there. Slots are written exactly
//! once, so content cannot be laundered by overwriting, and reads go through
//! capability-scoped handles that carry a label ceiling.
//!
//! Two structural guarantees, both enforced by the type system rather than by
//! runtime checks:
//!
//! - **Write-once**: [`SlotWriter::write`] consumes the writer, so a second write
//!   does not compile.
//! - **Label floor**: the writer's label is fixed when the writer is minted, by the
//!   policy layer, never chosen by the code doing the writing.
//!
//! A slot may also be **deferred**: it names a file it has not read, and the bytes arrive when
//! something finally needs them. What is deferred is only the reading. The slot is spoken for
//! from the moment it is deferred, its label is decided then rather than by whatever turns up,
//! and the reading is a single filling that cannot be repeated. Nothing may read a deferred
//! slot in the meantime: [`SlotStore::take_for_effect`] and [`SlotReader::read`] refuse it by
//! name rather than returning nothing, so a consumer that forgot to ask for the file is an
//! error and never an empty document.
