//! Isolated processors: the one thing that reads quarantined content.
//!
//! The planner cannot read an untrusted file, which is the whole point, and that leaves a gap:
//! an agent that may not look at a file also cannot change it. `edit_file` refuses, because
//! locating a passage is a comparison, and `write_file` needs a body the planner would have to
//! have written blind.
//!
//! A processor closes that gap without weakening anything. It is a second model instance that
//! holds no capabilities at all: no tools, no conversation, no memory of the session, no
//! workspace, no way to spawn anything. It reads the slots the driver hands it and produces
//! text. That text is not returned to the planner either; it goes straight into a new slot at
//! the label its inputs taint it to, and the planner gets a reference.
//!
//! So injected text in a processor's input can do exactly one thing: change the bytes in a slot
//! nobody has read. It cannot redirect an effect, because it never reaches a routing field. It
//! cannot widen its own access, because a [`ProcessorSpec`] is built by the driver, frozen
//! before the run, and holds no way to add a slot. It cannot persist, because the processor is
//! gone when the call returns.
//!
//! What a processor is **not** is a sandbox in the operating-system sense. There is no untrusted
//! code here to confine: the code making the call is the driver's own, and `bravebot-sandbox` exists
//! for processes that run someone else's. The confinement is the capability set, which is empty,
//! and the label on the output, which no part of the processor chooses.
