//! A session that leaves nothing behind.
//!
//! Ordinarily a session is worth keeping: the prompts a person typed, the record of what happened,
//! and the model and theme they chose all outlive the run that produced them, and
//! [`crate::policy`] treats that directory as the user's own configuration surface. Sometimes it is
//! not worth keeping. Work on someone else's machine, a prompt naming something private, a
//! demonstration in front of a room: in each case the value of the record is negative, and the
//! person wants the session and nothing else.
//!
//! Engaging this says so once, at startup, and every place that would write to the user's own
//! directory declines instead.
//!
//! # Reading is not writing
//!
//! An incognito session still reads. It loads the settings, the chosen model, the theme, and the
//! credentials that let it reach a backend at all, because a mode that could not authenticate
//! would not be a private session but a broken one. What it does not do is add to any of that.
//! This is the same shape as a browser's private window, and for the same reason: the promise is
//! about what survives the session, not about what the session may know.
//!
//! # One way
//!
//! There is no way to turn it off. A flag that could be cleared would mean every write site had to
//! reason about when it was cleared and by what, and a single missed ordering would write the
//! thing the mode exists to not write. Engaging is therefore a one-way door for the life of the
//! process, and [`engaged`] answers the same way from any thread that asks.
//!
//! # What this is not
//!
//! It is not confinement. Nothing here stops a subprocess the user asked for from writing wherever
//! their own shell could, and the `write_file` and `edit_file` tools go on editing the workspace,
//! which is the work rather than a trace of it. The guarantee is about this process and the
//! directory this process owns. [`bravebot-sandbox`] is the crate that confines somebody else's
//! code, and it confines subprocesses rather than this one.
