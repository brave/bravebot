//! Rules a person wrote down in advance about which actions to ask them about.
//!
//! The same three lists Claude Code keeps, with the same spellings, so a `permissions` block
//! copied out of `~/.claude/settings.json` governs this agent unedited. A rule is `Tool` or
//! `Tool(specifier)`, the lists are consulted deny, then ask, then allow, and the first match in
//! that order decides. See `docs/specs/permissions.md`.
//!
//! # What a rule may be about
//!
//! A specifier matches a **routing** field and nothing else: a path, or the argv of a stage.
//! Routing is `(T,pub)` before it reaches any gate, so matching on it is the driver deciding from
//! trusted input, which is what it is for. Nothing here is ever handed a file's contents, a
//! program's output, or anything else a turn observed. A rule that matched on those would be the
//! driver branching on untrusted bytes, whatever the rule said.
//!
//! # What an allow rule grants, and what it deliberately does not
//!
//! It answers a prompt, and that is all. It does **not** make a command's output trusted.
//! Pressing `a` at a run prompt grants those two things together, because a person looking at one
//! command can be asked to answer for both; a pattern like `curl *` covers commands nobody has
//! read, so it cannot carry the second claim. An allow rule that trusted output would let one
//! line in a settings file turn fetched bytes into routing, which is the whole thing the labels
//! exist to stop. So output keeps the label it would have had, and a rule only stops the asking.
//!
//! For the same reason an allow rule never answers the confidentiality question: a run that
//! releases the user's private data asks whatever the rules say, because vouching for a command
//! is not consenting to hand it that data.
//!
//! # Nothing here widens reach
//!
//! Rules decide what is asked about, never what is reachable. A path outside the workspace and
//! the directories the user opened is refused because it is out of reach, and no allow rule brings
//! it back: `additionalDirectories` is a separate statement, and one that asks for a directory
//! rather than opening it.
