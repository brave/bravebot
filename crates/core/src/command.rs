//! Running programs, as a pipeline of separately approved stages.
//!
//! This is the one place the repository admits command execution, and the reason it can is
//! narrow: **there is no command string.** A stage is a program name and a vector of arguments,
//! executed directly. No shell interprets it, so there is no parser to defeat and no
//! metacharacter to smuggle. An argument containing `; rm -rf /` is one argument and stays one
//! argument, because nothing ever splits it.
//!
//! That is what restores the routing/content distinction the exclusion in CLAUDE.md was about. A
//! shell string is destination and payload fused, with nothing a person could approve in
//! isolation. An argv vector is a destination a person can read, approve, and have executed
//! verbatim.
//!
//! # What is controlled, and what is not
//!
//! Not the programs. There is no allowlist, and spawned programs run with whatever access the
//! user's own shell would give them. That is deliberate: `git push` needs `~/.ssh`, `npm install`
//! reads `~/.npmrc` and writes `node_modules`, and the set of programs someone might reasonably
//! ask for cannot be enumerated in advance. A confinement profile narrow enough to be worth
//! having would break ordinary tools, so none is imposed.
//!
//! What is controlled is the boundary that holds *without* knowing what ran:
//!
//! - **argv is routing**, so it must be `(T,pub)` and endorsed by a person before anything
//!   executes. This is the real control point, and it is the same one a write goes through.
//! - **stdout and stderr are always `(U,priv)`.** Every stage, no exceptions, and nothing a
//!   caller or the model can declare changes it. A program may print anything, including bytes an
//!   earlier stage read out of a file an attacker wrote, so that is the only label that holds.
//! - **stdin is content**, so it may be untrusted. It is carried into the process and never
//!   consulted, which is what lets untrusted data reach `sed` or `awk` without the planner or the
//!   driver reading it.
//!
//! # Why every run asks
//!
//! There is no read-only category, because there is no way to establish one. `foo --bar` might
//! write to disk and nothing here can tell. An earlier draft had each stage declare whether it
//! wrote or reached the network and used that to skip the prompt; it was dropped because a
//! declaration is only worth something if it is honest, and an unprompted write from a stage that
//! claimed otherwise is worse than a prompt nobody wanted. So the answer to "does this change
//! anything" is always "assume so", and a person decides.
//!
//! Private stdin is a second, independent reason to ask. Untrusted is about integrity and is fine
//! here, since carrying bytes decides nothing. Private is about confidentiality, and handing the
//! user's data to a program releases it somewhere this policy no longer governs.
