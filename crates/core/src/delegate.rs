//! Delegated agents: a second planner, narrower than the first.
//!
//! A processor holds no capabilities at all, and the reason is written down in
//! [`crate::processor`]: a processor with one tool would be a second planner with untrusted
//! content in its context, which is the thing this design refuses. A delegate is the other half
//! of that sentence. It holds capabilities and it holds no untrusted content: it quarantines what
//! it may not read exactly as the first planner does, and gets a reference back. So the objection
//! to a processor with tools is not an objection to this.
//!
//! What it buys is a context nothing has to be told twice. A planner that runs the build reads
//! the whole log; one that asks a delegate to run the build is told what failed. The work happens
//! either way, and only one of them spends the conversation on it.
//!
//! Three things are fixed before a delegate exists, and none of them by the model:
//!
//! - **Its capabilities**, which are its kind's narrowed by the parent's. Delegation
//!   redistributes authority and never creates it, so a delegate can hold nothing the turn that
//!   spawned it did not already hold.
//! - **Its prompt**, which is a constant per kind. The planner names a kind and cannot describe
//!   one, so there is no sentence it can write that changes what a delegate is.
//! - **Its bound**, which is its kind's. Nobody is watching a delegate the way a person watches
//!   a turn, and the thing being bounded is futility rather than danger.
//!
//! It still asks. Every write and every run a delegate performs passes the same gates with the
//! same single-use endorsements, so a person sees the path and the diff whoever proposed them.
//! What a delegate saves is context, never approval.
