//! Which paths a user vouches for.
//!
//! The kernel decides *whether* a write needs a person's approval by asking two questions:
//! is the destination somewhere the user vouched for, and is the data trusted? A write of
//! trusted data to a trusted path is ordinary work and needs no interruption. Anything else
//! is shown to a person, because that is where a mistake cannot be undone by a later step.
//!
//! # Most specific rule wins
//!
//! Trust is recorded per path prefix, and the *longest* matching prefix decides. Both
//! polarities are expressible, so a trusted project may contain an untrusted subtree, and
//! that subtree may in turn contain a trusted path again:
//!
//! ```text
//!   .            (unset)
//!   src          trusted     → src/main.rs is trusted
//!   src/vendor   untrusted   → src/vendor/lib.js is untrusted
//!   src/vendor/ours.js trusted → trusted again, being more specific
//! ```
//!
//! # Why writing untrusted data marks the destination untrusted
//!
//! Without that rule the trust store would launder data. A turn could fetch a page, write
//! it into a trusted directory, read it back (now labelled trusted, because the path says
//! so) and use it for routing. Recording the destination as untrusted when untrusted bytes
//! land there closes the loop: what comes out of a file is never more trusted than what
//! went in.
//!
//! This crate performs no I/O; paths here are workspace-relative strings, compared by
//! segment. The caller is responsible for having resolved and confined them first.
