//! What the planner is told about content it may not see.
//!
//! The rule in CLAUDE.md is absolute: untrusted content never enters the planner's context.
//! But an agent still has to be able to work with untrusted files, reading them, editing them,
//! and moving text between them, so it needs *something* to reason about.
//!
//! That something is a [`Reference`]: a name for quarantined content plus facts about its
//! shape. A line count, a byte count, a label. Never a byte of the content itself.
//!
//! The model addresses content by reference, say "replace lines 40 to 60 of `ref:3`", and the
//! kernel resolves the reference when the effect fires. Nothing the model says can widen a
//! reference into the bytes behind it, because the bytes only exist inside the slot store.
//!
//! Trusted content needs none of this. It came from a path the user vouched for, so there is
//! no injected text to keep out and the planner may read it directly. References are for the
//! untrusted case, which is the default until a user says otherwise.
