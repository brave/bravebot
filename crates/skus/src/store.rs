//! Keeping the imported credentials in a mode-0600 file under `~/.bravebot`.
//!
//! # One batch, whichever channel it came from
//!
//! There is a single file, so importing from Nightly replaces what was imported from Stable. The
//! channel says where to *read the order id from*, which is a fact about the machine's browsers, not
//! about the agent: one person's subscription is one subscription however many Brave builds they
//! have installed, and every import registers this same install as a device against it.
//!
//! Keeping one per channel implied a choice the user never made. It also meant a stale batch from a
//! channel long since uninstalled sat there being reported, and a re-import after switching channels
//! left the old file to be picked up by whichever load happened to reach it first.
//!
//! # Why not the OS keychain
//!
//! These are bearer secrets, so the keychain looks like the obvious home for them, and it was that
//! for a while. It was the wrong call on both halves of the trade.
//!
//! The browser these are imported from keeps the same secret in a plain preference. `skus.state`
//! and `brave.ai_chat.premium_credential_cache` are unencrypted JSON in the profile, and nothing
//! under brave-core's `components/skus` or `components/ai_chat` references OSCrypt for them. So a
//! keychain here guarded a copy of something already readable in the file the copy came from.
//!
//! Nor does it hold against the threat it was written for, which was a program `run` launches
//! reading the file. Those are deliberately unconfined (RUN-10), and the AWS credentials that sign
//! every model request are cached by the `aws` CLI in plain 0600 JSON, so anything able to read a
//! file here can already take the larger secret. Guarding the smaller one behind the keychain
//! bought a password dialog, not a boundary: [`Wallet`] holds the whole decrypted batch in memory
//! for the session either way.
//!
//! What it did cost was availability. The keychain crate builds one Linux backend, the D-Bus
//! Secret Service, so a machine reached over SSH with no desktop session had no store to open at
//! all and every such user was silently on the free tier.
//!
//! # Why the whole batch is stored, not one cookie
//!
//! A time-limited-v2 credential is single-use. Presenting one to the backend spends it, so what is
//! stored is the batch the server signed, and a request takes the next unspent one. Caching a
//! ready-made cookie value would mean replaying a spent credential on the second request.
