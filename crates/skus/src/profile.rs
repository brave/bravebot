//! Finding the Leo order id in a local Brave install.
//!
//! # Where the subscription state actually lives
//!
//! Not in the profile directory, which is the natural guess and is wrong. `skus.state` began as a
//! profile preference and was moved to the browser-wide `Local State` file (brave-core's
//! `MigrateSkusSettings`), so a current install has it there and an empty `skus.state` in
//! `Default/Preferences`. Both are read here, `Local State` first, because an install that has
//! not launched since the migration still has the old copy.
//!
//! It is stored in the clear. Chromium encrypts cookies and passwords with OSCrypt, which on
//! macOS means a Keychain prompt, but `skus.state` is a plain preference and nothing under
//! brave-core's `components/skus` references OSCrypt at all. So reading it needs no Keychain
//! access and no user prompt.
//!
//! The value is a JSON string *inside* the preference JSON, so it is parsed twice. That is not a
//! quirk of this reader: the SKU SDK treats the pref as opaque key/value storage and serialises
//! its own state into it.
//!
//! # Only the order id leaves this module
//!
//! The file also holds the browser's own signed credentials, and they are deliberately not read.
//! Spending them would consume a device slot the browser is using. Everything else this import
//! needs, the item id and how many credentials to ask for, comes from the server in response to
//! the order id, which is also more current than the profile's copy after a renewal.
