//! AWS Signature Version 4, for requests to Bedrock.
//!
//! The second signing scheme in this crate and unrelated to the first: Brave's services sign a body
//! digest with a long-lived derived key, AWS signs a description of the whole request with a key
//! derived per day, region, and service. Both are HMAC-SHA256 over a canonical string, which is why
//! they share a crate and its two dependencies.
//!
//! ```text
//! Authorization: AWS4-HMAC-SHA256 Credential=<id>/<date>/<region>/<service>/aws4_request,
//!                SignedHeaders=host;x-amz-content-sha256;x-amz-date,
//!                Signature=<hex(hmac(signing_key, string_to_sign))>
//! ```
//!
//! What is signed is a hash of the canonical request: method, path, query, the signed headers, and
//! the body's hash. Any of those changing invalidates the signature, which is what binds a signature
//! to one request rather than to a body alone.
//!
//! Only what Bedrock needs is implemented. Every request is a POST with a body, no query string, and
//! three signed headers, so there is no query-parameter canonicalisation and no multi-value header
//! folding here. A caller signing something else would need both.
