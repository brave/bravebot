# program narrows it: this directory holds the prompt history, and at the umask that is readable by
# every local account. Both the directory and the record are created with the mode they keep rather
# than chmod'ed once they exist, since the other order leaves them open for the moment in between;
# the chmod is what narrows a directory an earlier install left, and the record is removed and
# written again rather than written over. A link is stepped over rather than followed, as the
# program steps over one: chmod without -h resolves it on both platforms this supports, so a
# linked directory would have an install setting the mode of wherever the link leads, which is
# outside anything this was given.
